//! The usage-sharing element.
//!
//! The usage-sharing element collects a filtered subset of the evidence from a
//! request, batches it into a GZip-compressed XML document and POSTs it to a
//! configurable 51Degrees endpoint on a background thread. It implements the
//! [usage-sharing-element specification](https://github.com/51Degrees/specifications/blob/main/pipeline-specification/pipeline-elements/usage-sharing-element.md).
//!
//! # Architecture
//!
//! Processing follows the recommended producer/consumer design. The `process`
//! function does the minimum work on the request thread: apply the ignore
//! filter, roll the share dice, consult the repeat-evidence tracker, extract
//! the wanted evidence into a self-contained [`UsageRecord`], then hand it
//! to a bounded channel. A single background thread consumes the channel.
//! Once it holds the configured minimum entries it takes more until none
//! arrives within the take timeout or it holds twice the minimum, as the .NET
//! and Java pipelines do, then builds the XML and sends it.
//!
//! Usage sharing is expendable. A failure (a full queue, a send error, an
//! offline endpoint) is logged through the [`log`] facade and never disrupts
//! the rest of the pipeline, as the
//! [error-handling section](https://github.com/51Degrees/specifications/blob/main/pipeline-specification/pipeline-elements/usage-sharing-element.md#error-handling)
//! requires. Repeated failures are logged at most once a minute, with a count
//! of the failures since the last message.
//!
//! # What it shares
//!
//! The element accepts no evidence, so it never adds a key to the evidence a
//! pipeline accepts, and the cache keys, ETag and `Vary` header worked out
//! from that never depend on it. It shares instead what it finds, being every
//! evidence value in the flow data and, when a web integration gives the web
//! request as `server.http-request` (read with
//! [`Evidence::http_request`]), every value of that request. A key found in
//! both is shared once, with the evidence's value. Which of the keys it finds
//! are shared is decided by [`ShareUsageElement::shared_evidence_filter`].
//! The ignore filter reads every key of the evidence, but only the keys of
//! the web request that are shared.
//!
//! # Transport and the `share-usage-transport` feature
//!
//! Actually sending anything over the network is gated behind the crate's
//! `share-usage-transport` Cargo feature, which is **off by default**. The
//! feature exists because the built-in transport uses a blocking `reqwest`
//! client, and `reqwest` does not build for `wasm32-wasip1`.
//!
//! - With the feature **off** (the default), the element is constructed with a
//!   no-op transport. It still samples, filters, batches and deduplicates
//!   evidence like any pipeline element, but each batch is dropped rather than
//!   transmitted, so **no connection to 51Degrees is ever opened**. This is the
//!   state of a plain `cargo build` of any crate that does not turn the feature
//!   on.
//! - With the feature **on**, [`ShareUsageElement::new`] and
//!   [`ShareUsageElement::with_defaults`] wire up the blocking `reqwest`
//!   transport that POSTs to the configured endpoint
//!   ([`SHARE_USAGE_DEFAULT_URL`](crate::constants::SHARE_USAGE_DEFAULT_URL) by
//!   default).
//!
//! Sending usage data therefore requires two opt-ins: the element must be
//! added to the pipeline, *and* `share-usage-transport` must be enabled. The
//! Device Detection and IP Intelligence facade crates make both by default,
//! through their `share-usage` feature. On a target where the built-in client
//! cannot run (such as `wasm32-wasip1`) the feature is left off and the
//! element runs with the no-op transport.
//!
//! # Receiving the records
//!
//! [`ShareUsageElement::with_sink`] hands each batch to a caller's
//! [`UsageSink`] in place of the built-in transport, whether or not the
//! feature is on. The sink gets the records and the document the built-in
//! transport would send, and can add its own elements to each record. An
//! error or a panic in the sink fails that batch alone.
