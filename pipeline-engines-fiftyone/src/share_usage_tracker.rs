//! The repeat-evidence tracker for usage sharing.
//!
//! A user browsing a site generates many requests with identical usage data.
//! That duplicate data is discarded as early as possible, per the
//! [session-tracking section](https://github.com/51Degrees/specifications/blob/main/pipeline-specification/pipeline-elements/usage-sharing-element.md#session-tracking).
//! The tracker remembers recently seen evidence in a bounded, sharded LRU
//! cache. A request whose evidence matches a recent entry is not shared. The
//! matching entry's time is refreshed, so the suppression window slides while
//! a session stays active. Once an entry is older than the configured interval
//! it is treated as new again. When the cache is full the least recently seen
//! entry is evicted.
//!
//! Session id and sequence are excluded from the dedup key (by the
//! [`crate::EvidenceKeyFilterShareUsageTracker`]) so they cannot make every
//! request look unique.
