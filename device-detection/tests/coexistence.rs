//! Cross-facade on-premise coexistence.
//!
//! This integration test links the Device Detection on-premise Hash engine and
//! the IP Intelligence on-premise engine into a single binary, then runs a real
//! detection and a real lookup. It is the facade-level proof of the native
//! coexistence fact: IP Intelligence's common-cxx symbols are namespaced to
//! `ipi_fiftyoneDegrees*`, so the two native engines link side by side with no
//! collision.
//!
//! The Device Detection facade pulls `fiftyone-native` with the `dd` feature and
//! the IP Intelligence facade pulls it with the `ipi` feature. When both facades
//! are in one dependency graph Cargo unifies those into `["dd", "ipi"]`, which
//! links both namespaced builds. If the namespacing regressed, this test binary
//! would fail to link (duplicate-symbol) rather than fail an assertion.
//!
//! Each data file is resolved at run time. When a file is genuinely absent the
//! test skips that half rather than failing, so a checkout without the data
//! files is still green, while a developer (and CI) with them gets real coverage.
