/// # Credentials
///
/// A request needs a resource key, a license key, or both, and which of them
/// is present decides whether the caller names the properties it wants.
/// [`CloudRequestEngineBuilder::build`] settles the combination and refuses
/// the ones the service cannot answer as the caller intends.
///
/// A resource key states which properties it carries, so the service returns all
/// of them and ignores any property list sent with it.
///
/// ```no_run
/// # use fiftyone_cloud_request_engine::CloudRequestEngine;
/// let _engine = CloudRequestEngine::builder()
///     .resource_key("my-resource-key")
///     .build()
///     .unwrap();
/// ```
///
/// A license key alongside a resource key adds the products the license grants
/// to those the resource key carries, so the answer widens. A property list is
/// still ignored, because a resource key is present.
///
/// ```no_run
/// # use fiftyone_cloud_request_engine::CloudRequestEngine;
/// let _engine = CloudRequestEngine::builder()
///     .resource_key("my-resource-key")
///     .license_key("my-license-key")
///     .build()
///     .unwrap();
/// ```
///
/// A license key on its own carries no property list, so the caller names the
/// properties it wants and the service answers with those alone. The service
/// refuses a license-key request that names none.
///
/// ```no_run
/// # use fiftyone_cloud_request_engine::CloudRequestEngine;
/// let _engine = CloudRequestEngine::builder()
///     .license_key("my-license-key")
///     .values(["device.ismobile", "device.iscrawler"])
///     .build()
///     .unwrap();
/// ```
///
/// Settling the combination at build time means a request cannot fail for this
/// reason afterwards, so a downstream element always receives an answer rather
/// than meeting a configuration mistake as a failed request on the critical
/// path, where the pipeline has no data to work with.
///
/// # Discovery at build time
///
/// The accepted evidence keys (`evidencekeys`) and accessible properties
/// (`accessibleproperties`) depend on the keys, so they are fetched from the
/// cloud. The accessible properties are asked for with the resource key and,
/// when one is set, the license key, because a license key adds products
/// to those the resource key carries and the data request sends both. The
/// builder fetches both when it builds the engine, so a built
/// engine is fully resolved and immutable: there is no lazy first-use discovery.
/// If either fetch fails (for example the cloud is unavailable),
/// [`CloudRequestEngineBuilder::build`] returns an error rather than producing a
/// half-initialized engine.
///
/// An engine holding a license key and no resource key is the exception,
/// because the accessible-properties endpoint takes a resource key and refuses
/// a request without one. The builder therefore does not call it, and
/// [`CloudRequestEngine::public_properties`] is empty for such an engine. A
/// downstream cloud aspect engine treats that the same way as a resource key
/// that grants it no product, reading the response JSON and inferring each
/// property's type from the value.
///
/// # Persisting discovered state
///
/// Both discovery results depend only on the keys, so they can be lifted
/// out of one engine and injected into another to skip the build-time fetch
/// entirely. This matters on a short-lived host such as a `wasm32-wasip1` edge
/// instance, which would otherwise repeat the two round-trips on every cold
/// start. Build an engine, call [`CloudRequestEngineBuilder::export_state`] on the
/// builder to obtain a serializable [`CloudEngineState`], persist it in the host's
/// store, and pass it to the next builder's
/// [`CloudRequestEngineBuilder::set_state`]. When a state is supplied the builder
/// uses it and makes no discovery call. The engine itself holds only the working
/// values it needs and knows nothing about the snapshot.
///
/// # Recovery mode
///
/// Repeated request failures within a window trip a [`RecoveryGate`], which then
/// short-circuits requests for a recovery period so a slow or failing cloud
/// cannot stall consumer requests. See the
/// [recovery-mode section](https://github.com/51Degrees/specifications/blob/main/pipeline-specification/pipeline-elements/cloud-request-engine.md#recovery-mode).
