//! The recovery-mode gate that suspends cloud requests after repeated failures.
//!
//! This implements the
//! [recovery-mode section](https://github.com/51Degrees/specifications/blob/main/pipeline-specification/pipeline-elements/cloud-request-engine.md#recovery-mode)
//! of the specification.
//!
//! The gate counts failures within a sliding window. Once the count reaches the
//! configured threshold, it opens a recovery period during which every request
//! is short-circuited and reported as temporarily unavailable. After the
//! recovery period elapses, requests are allowed again and the failure count is
//! reset, so a single later failure does not immediately re-trip the gate.
//!
//! The gate is shared across threads (one engine, many concurrent flow data),
//! so its state lives behind a [`Mutex`]. The lock is held only for the brief
//! check or record, never across an HTTP call.
