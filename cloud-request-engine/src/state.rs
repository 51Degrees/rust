//! A serializable snapshot of the cloud engine's discovered state.
//!
//! A [`CloudRequestEngine`](crate::CloudRequestEngine) normally fetches two
//! things from the cloud the first time it is used: the accepted evidence keys
//! (`evidencekeys`) and the accessible properties (`accessibleproperties`). Both
//! depend only on the resource key, so for a given key they are stable.
//!
//! On a long-lived host that one-time discovery is cheap. On a short-lived host,
//! such as a `wasm32-wasip1` edge runtime where the instance is created and
//! discarded frequently, repeating those two round-trips on every cold start is
//! wasteful. [`CloudEngineState`] lets a consumer lift the discovered values out
//! of one engine, persist them in whatever store the host provides (a const baked
//! into the module, a key-value or config store, and so on), and inject them into
//! the next engine so it skips discovery entirely.
//!
//! The type round-trips through [`serde`], so it serializes to and from JSON (or
//! any other serde format) without loss. See
//! [`CloudRequestEngine::export_state`](crate::CloudRequestEngine::export_state)
//! to obtain a snapshot and
//! [`CloudRequestEngineBuilder::set_state`](crate::CloudRequestEngineBuilder::set_state)
//! to inject one.
