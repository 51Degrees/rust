//! The HTTP transport the engine uses to talk to the cloud service.
//!
//! The transport is abstracted behind the [`CloudHttpClient`] trait so the
//! engine logic (evidence filtering, response parsing, recovery) can be unit
//! tested without reaching the network. When the `reqwest-client` feature is
//! enabled, the crate provides `ReqwestClient`, a built-in transport wrapping a
//! blocking reqwest client. Without the feature (for example on a target where
//! reqwest does not build, such as `wasm32-wasip1`) a consumer supplies its own
//! [`CloudHttpClient`].
//!
//! A transport returns a [`CloudHttpResponse`] for any request that completed,
//! whatever the status code, so the engine can apply the cloud error rules to
//! non-success responses. A transport returns `Err` only when the request did
//! not complete at all (a connection failure, a timeout, a DNS error and so
//! on), which the engine maps to an [`fiftyone_pipeline_core::Error::CloudRequest`]
//! with a status code of zero.
