//! # 51Degrees cloud request engine
//!
//! The engine that offloads pipeline processing to the 51Degrees cloud service.
//! It implements the
//! [cloud-request-engine specification](https://github.com/51Degrees/specifications/blob/main/pipeline-specification/pipeline-elements/cloud-request-engine.md).
//!
//! ## What it does
//!
//! A pipeline usually has a single [`CloudRequestEngine`] followed by one or
//! more cloud aspect engines (device detection, IP intelligence and so on). The
//! request engine makes one HTTP call per flow data and stores the raw JSON
//! response, so the cloud aspect engines after it just deserialize the parts they
//! own without each making their own request. This keeps the number of HTTP
//! round-trips to one regardless of how many aspects are involved, which matters
//! because the HTTP time dominates.
//!
//! On [`fiftyone_pipeline_core::FlowElement::process`] the engine:
//!
//! 1. Filters the flow data's evidence down to the keys the server accepts (the
//!    accepted-evidence filter was resolved at build time, see
//!    [discovery](#discovery)) and strips each key's prefix following the evidence
//!    precedence rules, so `query.user-agent` becomes `user-agent` and a query
//!    value beats a header value of the same name.
//! 2. POSTs the result as url-encoded form data (with the credential, and the
//!    asked-for property list when there is one) to the `json` endpoint.
//! 3. Stores the raw JSON response body in its [`CloudRequestData`] under the
//!    `cloud` data key.
//!
//! ## Credentials and the properties asked for
//!
//! An engine authenticates with a resource key, a license key, or both, and
//! which of them is present decides whether the caller names the properties it
//! wants. [`CloudRequestEngineBuilder::build`] settles the combination and
//! refuses the ones the service cannot answer as the caller intends, with a
//! message naming the setting to change.
//!
//! ```no_run
//! # use fiftyone_cloud_request_engine::CloudRequestEngine;
//! // A resource key states which properties it carries, so it is used on its
//! // own and the service answers with all of them.
//! let _engine = CloudRequestEngine::builder()
//!     .resource_key("my-resource-key")
//!     .build()
//!     .unwrap();
//!
//! // A license key alongside a resource key adds the products it grants to
//! // those the resource key carries, so the answer widens.
//! let _engine = CloudRequestEngine::builder()
//!     .resource_key("my-resource-key")
//!     .license_key("my-license-key")
//!     .build()
//!     .unwrap();
//!
//! // A license key on its own names no properties, so the caller names the ones
//! // it wants and the service answers with those alone.
//! let _engine = CloudRequestEngine::builder()
//!     .license_key("my-license-key")
//!     .values(["device.ismobile", "device.iscrawler"])
//!     .build()
//!     .unwrap();
//! ```
//!
//! A resource key is public by design, because it travels to the browser inside a
//! script URL, so it is scoped to what a page is meant to read and it answers
//! with everything it carries whatever the call asked for. A license key stays on
//! the server and names what it wants per request, which is usually what a
//! server-side caller needs.
//!
//! Because the combination is settled when the engine is built, a request cannot
//! fail for this reason afterwards, so a downstream element always receives an
//! answer rather than meeting a configuration mistake as a failed request on the
//! critical path.
//!
//! A property the credential does not cover is left out of the answer without
//! comment, since the service answers `200` and names nothing it dropped as long
//! as one asked-for property is covered. The engine therefore compares what it
//! asked for against what arrived and reports the difference once, as a warning
//! on its element data and one line on stderr. It is an entitlement matter rather
//! than a fault, so the request stands and the remaining properties are used.
//!
//! ## Discovery
//!
//! The accepted evidence keys (`evidencekeys`) and accessible properties
//! (`accessibleproperties`) are fetched from the cloud. The builder fetches them
//! as it builds the engine, so a built engine is fully resolved and immutable
//! with no lazy first-use discovery. If a fetch fails,
//! [`CloudRequestEngineBuilder::build`] returns an error rather than producing a
//! half-initialized engine.
//!
//! The accessible-properties request carries the resource key and, when one is
//! set, the license key, because the cloud adds the products the license grants
//! to those of the resource key. An engine holding a license key and no resource
//! key is the exception, because the endpoint takes a resource key and refuses a
//! request without one. The builder does not call it for such an engine, which
//! therefore starts with no accessible properties, and a downstream cloud aspect
//! engine reads the response JSON and infers each property's type from the value,
//! as it already does for a resource key that grants it no product.
//!
//! Because both results depend only on the keys, a consumer can persist
//! them and skip the build-time fetch on the next start. The builder retains the
//! state it resolves, so [`CloudRequestEngineBuilder::export_state`] returns a
//! serializable [`CloudEngineState`] snapshot after a build, and
//! [`CloudRequestEngineBuilder::set_state`] injects one back in. The engine holds
//! only the working values it needs and knows nothing about the snapshot. This is
//! aimed at short-lived hosts such as `wasm32-wasip1` edge runtimes, where
//! repeating the two round-trips on every cold start would be wasteful.
//!
//! This build-time resolution is a deliberate deviation from the specification's
//! [updated start-up design](https://github.com/51Degrees/specifications/blob/main/pipeline-specification/pipeline-elements/cloud-request-engine.md#updated-design),
//! which makes discovery lazy (deferred to the first `Process`) so a
//! `SuppressProcessExceptions` pipeline can absorb a cloud outage at start-up.
//! Here the builder returns a `Result`, which a caller can always handle, and the
//! `set_state` path lets a host that must tolerate an unavailable cloud build from
//! a cached snapshot instead.
//!
//! ## Recovery mode
//!
//! Repeated request failures within a window trip a recovery gate, which
//! short-circuits requests for a recovery period so a slow or failing cloud
//! cannot stall consumer requests.
//!
//! ## Element data shape
//!
//! [`CloudRequestData`] (data key `cloud`) carries:
//!
//! | Field            | Type         | Description                            |
//! |------------------|--------------|----------------------------------------|
//! | `cloud`          | string       | The raw JSON response body.            |
//! | `json-response`  | string       | The same raw JSON, under an alias field name. |
//! | `process-started`| bool         | True once the engine began processing. |
//! | `warnings`       | string list  | Advisory messages, being the service's own warnings and, once per engine, any asked-for property that did not come back. |
//!
//! ## Testing
//!
//! The HTTP transport is abstracted behind [`CloudHttpClient`], so the engine
//! can be driven against an in-process fake in unit tests. A built-in blocking
//! transport backed by `reqwest` is available behind the `reqwest-client`
//! feature; without it a consumer supplies its own [`CloudHttpClient`] (for
//! example on `wasm32-wasip1`).
