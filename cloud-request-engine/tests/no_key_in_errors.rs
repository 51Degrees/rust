//! A failing cloud request must never print the resource key.
//!
//! Two ways the key reaches an error are covered here. The address of the
//! accessible-properties request carries the key as a query parameter, and the
//! service repeats the key back inside its own message when it cannot read the
//! key. Both paths run through the builder, which is what every live test and
//! every example calls, and both the `Display` and the `Debug` form are checked
//! because `unwrap` and `expect` print the `Debug` one.
