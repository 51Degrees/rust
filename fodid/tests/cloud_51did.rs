//! Live integration test: obtains a real 51Did from the 51Degrees cloud and
//! checks that it parses into a [`FodId`].
//!
//! The test uses a single resource key from the environment. Set
//! `51DEGREES_RESOURCE_KEY` (or one of the CI-exported tiered names
//! `_51DEGREES_RESOURCE_KEY_PAID` / `_51DEGREES_RESOURCE_KEY_FREE`) to a key
//! whose properties include `fodid.*`. Create one with the 51Degrees Configurator
//! sharing link <https://configure.51degrees.com/N57Wygby> (the free tier now
//! includes 51Did).
//!
//! This is a live test that needs the key plus network access, so it is marked
//! `#[ignore]` and is skipped by a plain `cargo test`. Run it explicitly with
//! `--include-ignored`:
//!
//! ```text
//! # set the key as an environment variable, then run:
//! #   PowerShell: $env:51DEGREES_RESOURCE_KEY = '<key>'
//! #   bash:       export 51DEGREES_RESOURCE_KEY=<key>
//! cargo test -p fodid --test cloud_51did -- --include-ignored
//!
//! # or supply it inline for a single run:
//! 51DEGREES_RESOURCE_KEY=<key> cargo test -p fodid --test cloud_51did -- --include-ignored
//! ```
//!
//! Run without a key it fails with those instructions instead of passing
//! silently.
//!
//! To exercise more than one key (for example a free key and a paid key), the
//! CI workflow runs this test once per `_51DEGREES_RESOURCE_KEY*` secret,
//! setting `51DEGREES_RESOURCE_KEY` to each in turn. The test itself only ever
//! reads the single variable.
//!
//! For each key the test checks the cloud `id.usage` levels. `non-marketing` is
//! available on any key that includes `fodid.*`, so it is required. `standard`
//! and `personalized` are marketing usages that paid keys are expected to grant
//! in due course; they are validated when the key returns them and reported
//! when it does not, so this test starts covering them automatically once a
//! paid key is expanded for marketing.
