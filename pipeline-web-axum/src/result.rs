//! The processed flow data, shared into request extensions and pulled back out
//! by an extractor.
//!
//! The middleware processes the pipeline once per request and stores the result
//! so a downstream handler can read it without reprocessing. A
//! [`fiftyone_pipeline_core::FlowData`] is `Send` but not `Sync` (its element
//! data is only `Send`), and axum request extensions require a `Send + Sync`
//! value, so the flow data is wrapped in an `Arc<Mutex<..>>`. The lock is only
//! ever held briefly and synchronously while reading a result, never across an
//! `await`, so it does not block the runtime.
//!
//! Handlers read the flow data through the [`FiftyOneResult`] extractor, which
//! clones the shared handle out of the request extensions. From it,
//! [`FiftyOneResult::with`] borrows the locked flow data for a closure, and the
//! typed and string getters cover the common single-value reads.
