//! Building evidence from a request and running the pipeline off the async
//! runtime.
//!
//! Pipeline processing is synchronous and CPU-bound: an on-premise engine does
//! a non-trivial amount of work, and even the cloud engines block a thread on a
//! synchronous HTTP call. Running that directly inside an async task would stall
//! the runtime's worker thread, so [`process_request`] hands the work to
//! [`tokio::task::spawn_blocking`], which runs it on the blocking thread pool and
//! returns the processed [`FlowData`].
//!
//! The captured request parts (header map, URI, buffered body, peer address) are
//! moved into the blocking closure so it owns everything it reads. [`FlowData`]
//! is `Send`, so it travels back out of the closure to the caller.
