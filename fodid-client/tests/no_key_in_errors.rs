//! A failing 51Did call must never print the resource key or the licence key.
//!
//! The 51Did routes carry the resource key as part of the route, so the address
//! quotes it, and the service repeats the key back inside its own message when
//! it cannot read the key. Both the `Display` and the `Debug` form are checked,
//! because `unwrap` and `expect` print the `Debug` one.
