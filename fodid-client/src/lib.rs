//!
//! # 51Degrees identifier (51Did) client
//!
//! The server side of the 51Did two-step verification against the
//! 51Degrees cloud, and the Rust port of the client the .NET, Java, Node,
//! Python and PHP packages already carry. It fetches and caches the
//! published signing keys, verifies a 51Did signature offline against the
//! key in force when the identifier was created, verifies a signature
//! through the cloud, and redeems the sealed creator context result a
//! browser relays.
//!
//! Reading a 51Did is the [`fodid`] crate's job, and this crate builds on
//! it. Creating one is not part of either, because a 51Did is created from
//! the browser through the cloud `json` endpoint, since the identifier
//! describes the browser's own connection.
//!
//! ## The two steps
//!
//! A 51Did carries a creator context, being a record of the connection it
//! was created on. Checking that the identifier is being presented from
//! that same connection takes two steps, and the split exists so that the
//! account's licence key never reaches the browser.
//!
//! 1. **The browser verifies.** The page calls the cloud's `verify-context`
//!    (or `verify-full`) endpoint from the browser, so the cloud sees the
//!    browser's own connection and compares it with the context inside the
//!    identifier. The cloud answers with a sealed result, which the browser
//!    cannot read or alter, and the page relays that result to its own
//!    server.
//! 2. **The server redeems.** The server calls [`DidClient::redeem`] with
//!    the identifier it knows independently, the sealed result the browser
//!    relayed, and the licence key only the server holds. The cloud opens
//!    the seal, confirms the result is for that identifier, is fresh and
//!    has not been redeemed before, and answers with a [`RedeemResult`]
//!    carrying the [`ContextOutcome`] and, for a mismatch, the
//!    [`FactorOutcome`] of each factor.
//!
//! One rule matters more than the rest, and every 51Did package applies it.
//! A factor of `misconfigured` is read on its own as
//! [`FactorOutcome::Misconfigured`] and never falls through to a mismatch,
//! because it says the checking service could not determine that factor,
//! and reading it as a mismatch would report a replay indicator for
//! something the identifier says nothing about.
//!
//! ## Signature checks without the cloud
//!
//! The cloud publishes the schedule of signing keys, each in force from its
//! start until the next one starts. [`DidClient::verify_signature`] fetches
//! that schedule once a day, keeps it in a per-instance cache, and checks an
//! identifier's signature against the key in force at its creation time
//! without a cloud call. [`DidClient::verify_signature_detailed`] says why a
//! check did not pass, as a [`SignatureCheck`], and only
//! [`SignatureCheck::Invalid`] means the identifier should be distrusted.
//!
//! ## Transport
//!
//! Every request goes through the [`DidHttpClient`] trait. The crate builds
//! without any network stack by default, so it compiles for
//! `wasm32-wasip1` and a host such as an edge runtime supplies its own
//! transport through [`DidClientBuilder::http_client`]. The `reqwest-client`
//! feature turns on the built-in `ReqwestClient`, a blocking `reqwest`
//! client, which the builder uses when no transport is given.
//!
//! Credentials never travel in a URL. The resource key is part of the
//! route, as the endpoints accept, and the licence key travels only in the
//! redeem form body, because a query string is written to access logs.
//!
//! ## Example
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use std::sync::Arc;
//! use fodid::FodId;
//! use fodid_client::{ContextOutcome, DidClient, DidHttpClient};
//!
//! # fn run(
//! #     transport: Arc<dyn DidHttpClient>,
//! #     encoded_51did: &str,
//! #     sealed_result: &str,
//! # ) -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
//! // One client for the process. The licence key stays on the server.
//! let client = DidClient::builder("your-resource-key")
//!     .licence_key("your-licence-key")
//!     .http_client(transport)
//!     .build()?;
//!
//! // The identifier the server knows independently, for example from a
//! // cookie it set when the identifier was created.
//! let fod_id = FodId::from_base64(encoded_51did)?;
//!
//! // Step one happened in the browser. Step two is the redemption.
//! let outcome = client.redeem(&fod_id, sealed_result, None)?;
//! match outcome.context() {
//!     ContextOutcome::Verified => { /* same connection as at creation */ }
//!     ContextOutcome::Mismatch => {
//!         // outcome.factors() names the factors that differ.
//!     }
//!     ContextOutcome::Misconfigured => {
//!         // The checking service, not the identifier, is at fault.
//!     }
//!     other => { /* see ContextOutcome for the rest */ let _ = other; }
//! }
//! # Ok(())
//! # }
//! ```
