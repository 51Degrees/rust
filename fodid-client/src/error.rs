//! What can go wrong, and whose problem each thing is.

//! Every field of free text an error carries goes through
//! [`crate::redact`] before it is shown, in both the `Display` and the `Debug`
//! form, because an address carries the resource key in its route and the
//! service repeats the key back inside its own message. `Debug` matters as
//! much as `Display`, since `unwrap` and `expect` print that one.
