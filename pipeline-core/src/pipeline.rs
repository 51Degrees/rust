//! The pipeline and its builder.
//!
//! A [`Pipeline`] groups an ordered list of flow elements into a single process.
//! It is immutable once built and shared via [`Arc`], so the same pipeline
//! serves many concurrent requests. See the
//! [conceptual overview](https://github.com/51Degrees/specifications/blob/main/pipeline-specification/conceptual-overview.md#pipeline).
//!
//! Build one with [`PipelineBuilder`]: add elements in execution order, then
//! call [`PipelineBuilder::build`] to obtain an `Arc<Pipeline>`.
