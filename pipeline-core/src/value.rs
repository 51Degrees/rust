//! Property value types.
//!
//! [`PropertyValue`] is a closed enum covering every value type the pipeline
//! specification expects, as listed in the
//! [properties specification](https://github.com/51Degrees/specifications/blob/main/pipeline-specification/features/properties.md#value-types).
//! Using an enum rather than a boxed `dyn Any` keeps the dynamic property bag
//! ([`crate::ElementData::get`]) self-describing and avoids reflection.

///
/// This is the metadata "Type" column from the
/// [properties specification](https://github.com/51Degrees/specifications/blob/main/pipeline-specification/features/properties.md#property-metadata).
/// It mirrors the variants of [`PropertyValue`] so that a piece of metadata can
/// describe what kind of value a property returns without an instance of it. It
/// is a small enum, which keeps the core reflection-free.

/// - [`PropertyValue::String`], [`PropertyValue::Bool`],
///   [`PropertyValue::Integer`] and [`PropertyValue::Double`] are the scalar
///   types.
/// - [`PropertyValue::StringList`] is the "array of strings" type.

///   carrying a snippet intended to run on the client device. It is a distinct
///   variant (rather than a plain string) so the JSON and JavaScript builder
///   elements can recognise it without separate metadata.
/// - [`PropertyValue::KeyValueList`] is the "array of key-value-pair
///   collections" type, used where an element returns several sub-records (for
///   example TAC lookup or hardware-profile lookup).
