//! Evidence: the immutable, case-insensitive input to a flow data instance.
//!
//! This module implements the
//! [evidence specification](https://github.com/51Degrees/specifications/blob/main/pipeline-specification/features/evidence.md).
//! The key points it enforces:
//!
//! - Keys are case-insensitive. They are lowercased when an [`Evidence`] is
//!   built, so all later lookups are exact and need no per-lookup case folding.
//! - Values are kept exactly as supplied (values are case-sensitive).
//! - Keys are usually `prefix.field`. [`EvidencePrefix`] models the known
//!   prefixes and their precedence: `query` > `header` > `cookie` > `server` >
//!   `fiftyone` > `location`, then any other prefix in alphabetical order.
//! - Once built, an [`Evidence`] is immutable, so concurrent `&` reads are safe
//!   with no locking (see the
//!   [thread-safety specification](https://github.com/51Degrees/specifications/blob/main/pipeline-specification/features/thread-safety.md#evidence)).
