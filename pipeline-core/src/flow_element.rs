//! The flow element trait: a black box that processes flow data.
//!
//! A flow element reads evidence and earlier element data from a
//! [`crate::FlowData`] and may add its own element data. See the
//! [conceptual overview](https://github.com/51Degrees/specifications/blob/main/pipeline-specification/conceptual-overview.md#flow-element).
//!
//! # Design choice: object-safe `dyn` trait, not an associated type
//!
//! A pipeline holds a heterogeneous, ordered list of elements that produce
//! different element-data types. To store them in a single `Vec` and run them
//! in order, [`FlowElement`] is kept **object-safe** so the pipeline can hold
//! `Arc<dyn FlowElement>` trait objects.
//!
//! That rules out putting the element-data type as an associated type or a
//! generic parameter on this trait (either would make `dyn FlowElement`
//! impossible). Instead the type linkage lives in [`crate::TypedKey<T>`]: a
//! concrete element exposes a `TypedKey<T>` for its own data through its own
//! inherent API, and [`crate::FlowData::get`] uses it to downcast. This is the
//! "no-reflection core" approach from the plan and realises mechanisms 1 and 2
//! of the
//! [access-to-results specification](https://github.com/51Degrees/specifications/blob/main/pipeline-specification/features/access-to-results.md)
//! without a generic on the stored element.
//!
//! # Thread safety
//!
//! `process` takes `&self`, so one shared element instance serves many
//! concurrent flow data, as required by the
//! [thread-safety specification](https://github.com/51Degrees/specifications/blob/main/pipeline-specification/features/thread-safety.md#flow-elements).
//! The trait is therefore `Send + Sync`. Any per-request scratch state must be
//! created inside `process`; any hot mutable state (for example a reloadable
//! data file) belongs behind a synchronisation primitive owned by the element.
