//! Shared case-insensitive lookup helper for the crate's lowercased-key maps.
//!
//! Several stores in this crate ([`crate::Evidence`], [`crate::FlowData`] and
//! [`crate::MapElementData`]) keep their keys lowercased on insertion and then
//! match lookups case-insensitively. [`ci_get`] is the single implementation of
//! that "try the key as supplied, then its lowercased form" rule, so every site
//! behaves identically.

use std::collections::HashMap;

use ahash::RandomState;

/// Look up `key` in a map whose keys are stored lowercased, matching
/// case-insensitively.
///
/// The fast path tries the key exactly as supplied (most keys are already
/// lowercase, so this hits without allocating). Only on a miss for a key that
/// has uppercase letters does it allocate a lowercased copy and retry, because
/// a lowercase key that missed would miss again.
