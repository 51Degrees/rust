//! The pipeline error model.
//!
//! This follows the custom exception hierarchy described in the
//! [exception-handling specification](https://github.com/51Degrees/specifications/blob/main/pipeline-specification/features/exception-handling.md),
//! expressed as a single [`enum@Error`] enum so callers can match on the cause.
//!
//! Two distinct "value is absent" conditions are kept separate, because they
//! mean different things to the caller and carry different remedies:
//!
//! - [`NoValueError`] means the property exists in the result set but the
//!   element chose not to set a value (for example, device detection could not
//!   determine the value from the supplied evidence). This is the
//!   ["null values" rule](https://github.com/51Degrees/specifications/blob/main/pipeline-specification/features/properties.md#null-values).
//! - [`Error::PropertyMissing`] means the property is not present in the result
//!   set at all (for example, it is excluded by the license, the data file or
//!   the resource key). This is the
//!   ["missing properties" rule](https://github.com/51Degrees/specifications/blob/main/pipeline-specification/features/properties.md#missing-properties).
