//! Flow data: the unit of work that flows through a pipeline.
//!
//! A flow data holds the immutable [`Evidence`] for one request, the element
//! data produced as it is processed, and any errors recorded along the way. It
//! keeps an [`Arc`] back-reference to the pipeline that created it, so it can be
//! processed by simply calling [`FlowData::process`]. See the
//! [conceptual overview](https://github.com/51Degrees/specifications/blob/main/pipeline-specification/conceptual-overview.md#flow-data).
//!
//! A flow data belongs to exactly one pipeline and is created by it
//! ([`crate::Pipeline::create_flow_data`]). It is intended to be used on a
//! single thread, per the
//! [thread-safety specification](https://github.com/51Degrees/specifications/blob/main/pipeline-specification/features/thread-safety.md#flow-data),
//! so its accessors take `&self`/`&mut self` and need no internal locking.
