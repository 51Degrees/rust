//! The scripts 51Degrees ships, compiled into the crate.
//!
//! The text of each script is embedded at build time rather than read from a
//! file, so an element carrying one runs where there is no file system and
//! where fetching a file over the network would defeat the purpose, such as in
//! a WebAssembly host or at an edge runtime. A caller that wants a script of
//! its own passes the text in instead, which
//! [`Script::compile`](crate::Script::compile) reads.
