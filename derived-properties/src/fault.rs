//! What is wrong with a script.

//! the document such as `Rules[3].When.All[1]`, a line where the parser can
//! supply one, and a plain message. All the faults in one script are collected
//! and reported together, so one build shows everything wrong with a file
//! rather than stopping at the first problem.
