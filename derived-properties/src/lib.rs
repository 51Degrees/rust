//!
//! # Derived properties
//!
//! [`DerivedPropertyElement`] turns property values that are already in the
//! flow data into one more property value. That is the whole of its scope. It
//! holds no data file, sends no request over the network, keeps nothing between
//! one request and the next, and reads no evidence from the request.
//!
//! How a property is computed is written in a **script**, which is one YAML or
//! JSON file describing one output property. The script format is shared
//! between every 51Degrees language implementation, at
//! [51Degrees/derived-properties](https://github.com/51Degrees/derived-properties),
//! so one script gives the same answer in every language. This crate reads
//! format 1 and is tested against the same conformance cases as the other
//! languages.
//!
//! ## The one rule
//!
//! A script names source properties inside its conditions. Where every one of
//! those properties is available, the checks and the rules run and a value is
//! chosen. Where any one of them is not available, the script produces no
//! value, and the message names every property that was missing along with what
//! its source element said about each one. There is no third state.
//!
//! ## The scripts are compiled in
//!
//! The scripts 51Degrees ships are embedded in this crate at build time rather
//! than read from a file, so an element carrying one runs where there is no
//! file system and where fetching a file over the network would defeat the
//! purpose, such as in a WebAssembly host or at an edge runtime. A caller may
//! also supply the text of a script of its own, and
//! [`DerivedPropertyElementBuilder::add_script_file`] reads one from a file
//! where there is a file system to read it from.
//!
//! ## In a pipeline
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use fiftyone_derived_properties::{BuiltInScript, DerivedPropertyElement};
//!
//! let element = DerivedPropertyElement::builder()
//!     .add_built_in(BuiltInScript::HumanConfidence)
//!     .build()
//!     .expect("the shipped script is known to be sound");
//! ```
//!
//! Add the element to a pipeline **after** the elements that supply the
//! properties its scripts name, then read the result from the flow data under
//! the key `derived`.
//!
//! ## Without a pipeline
//!
//! A script runs over any [`PropertySource`], so a host that already holds the
//! values can run one without building a pipeline at all.
//!
//! ```
//! use fiftyone_derived_properties::{
//!     BuiltInScript, Lookup, MapSource, Outcome, SourceValue,
//! };
//!
//! let script = BuiltInScript::HumanConfidence.compile().unwrap();
//! let source = MapSource::new()
//!     .with("device.IsCrawler", Lookup::Value(SourceValue::Bool(false)))
//!     .with("device.IsHeadless", Lookup::Value(SourceValue::Bool(false)))
//!     // Read as text, not as a boolean, because the data carries the string
//!     // Unknown until the client side JavaScript has run.
//!     .with(
//!         "device.HasWebDriver",
//!         Lookup::Value(SourceValue::Text("False".to_owned())),
//!     )
//!     .with(
//!         "device.IsVisible",
//!         Lookup::Value(SourceValue::Text("True".to_owned())),
//!     )
//!     .with("device.BrowserReleaseYear", Lookup::Value(SourceValue::Int(2026)))
//!     .with("device.BrowserReleaseAge", Lookup::Value(SourceValue::Int(1)))
//!     .with("ip.HumanProbability", Lookup::Value(SourceValue::Int(9)))
//!     .with(
//!         "ip.ConnectionType",
//!         Lookup::Value(SourceValue::Text("Broadband".to_owned())),
//!     );
//!
//! match script.evaluate(&source) {
//!     Outcome::Value(value) => assert_eq!(value.to_text(), "High"),
//!     Outcome::NoValue { message, .. } => panic!("{message}"),
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! Leave one of those properties out and the script produces no value, naming
//! the property that was missing, which is the other half of what a script can
//! do.
