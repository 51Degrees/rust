//! # 51Degrees JSON builder
//!
//! The JSON builder element serialises every piece of element data in a
//! [`fiftyone_pipeline_core::FlowData`] into a single JSON object and stores it
//! on the flow data under the [`JSON_PROPERTY_KEY`] property of its own element
//! data. It implements the
//! [json-builder specification](https://github.com/51Degrees/specifications/blob/main/pipeline-specification/pipeline-elements/json-builder.md).
//!
//! The JSON it produces is what the client-side `51Degrees.core.js` and the
//! callback endpoint consume, so the JavaScript builder and the web layers
//! depend on its exact shape. See [`JsonBuilderElement`] for the field
//! conventions and a worked example.
//!
//! ## What it emits
//!
//! Each remaining element's data becomes a nested object keyed by that element's
//! lowercased data key. Within it, every property is emitted by its lowercased
//! name, plus the sibling keys described on [`JsonBuilderElement`]
//! (`nullreason`, `delayexecution`, `evidenceproperties`). The list of
//! JavaScript-typed property paths is collected into a top-level
//! [`JAVASCRIPT_PROPERTIES_KEY`] array, and any flow errors are appended under
//! [`ERRORS_KEY`].
//!
//! ## Determinism
//!
//! The serialiser uses `serde_json` with the `preserve_order` feature so the
//! key order is the insertion order rather than a hash order. Insertion order is
//! itself made deterministic by sorting element keys and property names, so the
//! same flow data always yields byte-identical JSON. That stability is what lets
//! downstream code compute a reliable ETag from the JSON.
