//! Resolution of the optional self-hosted cloud endpoint from the environment.

/// The environment variable giving an optional cloud endpoint, used to point the
/// cloud examples at a host other than the public 51Degrees cloud at
/// `https://cloud.51degrees.com/api/v4/`. This is the same variable the cloud
/// request engine reads as its base URL override, so a single value configures
/// both.
///
/// A host other than cloud.51degrees.com would be used to (a) use an on premise
/// web server, or (b) use a privately hosted version of the 51Degrees cloud for
/// performance reasons. This is the private hosting option of the 51Degrees
/// cloud service. Both run the same service as the public cloud, so every
/// example works unchanged against them. Every cloud example in this workspace
/// honours this variable, either by passing [`cloud_endpoint_from_env`] to its
/// builder or by leaving the endpoint unset so the cloud request engine reads
/// the variable itself, and the value is normalised to end in one `/`.
pub const CLOUD_ENDPOINT_ENV_VAR: &str = "51DEGREES_CLOUD_ENDPOINT";

/// Read the optional cloud endpoint from [`CLOUD_ENDPOINT_ENV_VAR`].
///
/// Returns the trimmed value when the variable is set to a non-blank string, or
/// [`None`] to use the library default. Surrounding whitespace is stripped (a
/// stray space or newline from a shell or `.env` file is a common slip), so the
/// value passed to the builder is clean.
///
/// Only presence and blankness are screened here. The endpoint's URL format (a
/// valid `http(s)` scheme and host) is validated by the cloud request engine when
/// it builds, so a malformed value surfaces as a clear configuration error rather
/// than a confusing request failure.
