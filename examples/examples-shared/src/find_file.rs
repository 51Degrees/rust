//! Locate a data or resource file by walking up the directory tree.

//! sibling repositories checked out
//! alongside the workspace, so the path differs depending on whether an example
//! is run from an IDE, from its own crate directory, or from a CI checkout. The
//! finder walks up from the starting directory through its ancestors so the file
