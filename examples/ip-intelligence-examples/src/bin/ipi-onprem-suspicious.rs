/*
 * @example ipi-onprem-suspicious.rs
 *
 * This example shows how to combine 51Degrees on-premise IP Intelligence
 * properties to judge whether an IP address is a likely source of suspicious
 * requests.
 *
 * You will learn:
 *
 * 1. How to request the diversity and behavioral properties (IsCellular,
 *    HardwareDiversity, BrowserDiversity, LocationConfidence, IsHosted,
 *    CountryCode, RegisteredCountry, HumanProbability) from the on-premise IP
 *    Intelligence engine.
 * 2. How to combine those diversity values with the observed and registered
 *    country to assess the likelihood of an IP being a source of suspicious
 *    activity.
 *
 * The IP is supplied as `query.client-ip` evidence and the result is read back
 * through the shared `IP_DATA_KEY`. The on-premise engine surfaces these
 * properties as weighted values, so each is reduced to its most probable
 * candidate before the heuristic runs. A property the data tier does not carry
 * reads back as a no-value and the contributing value falls through to its safe
 * default.
 *
 * The verdict combines three independent branches, matching the reference
 * example:
 *
 * 1. A high hardware diversity (>= 7) that is not cellular and has a low location
 *    confidence suggests a VPN or proxy.
 * 2. A hosted IP whose observed country differs from its registered country
 *    suggests VPN or proxy use.
 * 3. A browser diversity that exceeds the hardware diversity by more than two can
 *    mean devices running multiple browsers, a sign of suspicious activity.
 *
 * This is a basic illustration and should not be used in production without
 * further testing and tuning. Many other properties can contribute to a real
 * judgement.
 *
 * # Data file
 *
 * This example requires an Enterprise IP Intelligence data file (`.ipi`), which is
 * the tier that carries the diversity and behavioral properties. The data file is
 * resolved by `examples_shared::ipi_data_path`. Contact 51Degrees for an
 * Enterprise file: <https://51degrees.com/contact-us?utm_source=code&utm_medium=example&utm_campaign=rust&utm_content=examples-ip-intelligence-examples-src-bin-ipi-onprem-suspicious.rs&utm_term=ipi-onprem-suspicious>.
