//! IP Intelligence web example: cloud Getting Started (server side).

//! It builds a cloud IP-intelligence pipeline (with usage sharing, as a web
//! deployment should), wraps it in a [`WebPipeline`] so the two client-side
//! endpoints (`/51Degrees.core.js` and `/51dpipeline/json`) are mounted, and
//! serves an HTML page that shows the weighted IP Intelligence (country,
//! location, network) for the connecting client's IP address, with a form to
//! look up any other address.

/*
 * @example ipi-web-getting-started-cloud.rs
 *
 * IP Intelligence cloud web example (server-side).
 *
 * This example demonstrates the 51Degrees Pipeline performing IP Intelligence in
 * the cloud inside a small axum web server. It shows:
 *
 *   1. Server-side IP Intelligence. The 51Degrees middleware (installed by
 *      `register`) runs the cloud pipeline for the incoming request, using the
 *      client's IP address (taken from `X-Forwarded-For` when behind a proxy,
 *      otherwise the connection peer) as evidence. The home-page handler reads
 *      the result through the `FiftyOneResult` extractor and renders the weighted
 *      network and location properties.
 *
 *   2. The probabilistic nature of IP Intelligence. Each property can return
 *      several candidate values, ordered high weighting first. The results table
 *      shows the most probable value with its weighting (a 0.0 to 1.0
 *      confidence).
 *
 *   3. An IP look-up form. A visitor can enter any IPv4 or IPv6 address; the form
 *      submits it as the `client-ip-51d` query parameter, which the cloud service
 *      accepts as the client-IP evidence, so the page re-renders for that address.
 *
 *   4. An approximate-location map. When the lookup resolves a latitude and
 *      longitude, the shared `examples.min.js` helper (`initLocationMap`) draws
 *      the point on a Leaflet map.
 *
 * Usage sharing is enabled (`ShareUsageElement`), which web deployments are
 * expected to do so anonymous evidence improves the data for everyone. The
 * console examples in this crate deliberately leave it off. The cloud elements
 * are assembled by hand (rather than through the facade `build()`) precisely so
 * the share-usage element can be added.
 *
 * The page is written to the shared 51Degrees example design system: it
 * references the vendored `examples-main.min.css` and `examples.min.js` (embedded
 * in the binary and served from `/static/...`) and uses the `.c-eg-*` class
 * contract for the results table, the evidence table, the IP form, the location
 * map and the `c-eg-message` contact-us banner.
 *
 * Build a resource key at https://configure.51degrees.com?utm_source=code&utm_medium=example&utm_campaign=rust&utm_content=examples-ip-intelligence-examples-src-bin-ipi-web-getting-started-cloud.rs&utm_term=ipi-web-getting-started-cloud and export it as
 * `51DEGREES_RESOURCE_KEY`, then run the binary and open http://127.0.0.1:8082.
