/*
 * @example ipi-onprem-offline-processing.rs
 *
 * The on-premise IP Intelligence offline (batch) processing example.
 *
 * It shows how to:
 *
 * 1. Build an on-premise IP Intelligence pipeline restricted to a few
 *    properties, using the `LowMemory` profile that suits a long batch run.
 * 2. Stream IP-address evidence records from a multi-document YAML file
 *    (`evidence.yml` in the ip-intelligence-data submodule), where each `---`
 *    separated document is a single client-IP key/value map.
 * 3. Process each record and write the inputs and the results back as a
 *    YAML-like document stream, suitable for piping to a file for later
 *    analysis.
 *
 * The evidence file is located with `examples_shared::find_file`, and the data
 * file with `examples_shared::ipi_data_path`. By default only the first 20
 * records are processed so the example finishes quickly; pass a different limit
 * by constructing `ExampleOptions::for_tier` directly.
