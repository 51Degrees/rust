/*
 * @example ipi-cloud-metadata.rs
 *
 * The Cloud service exposes metadata about the properties it can return and the
 * evidence it accepts. This example shows how to read that metadata from a built
 * cloud IP-intelligence pipeline and display it.
 *
 * You will learn:
 *
 * 1. How to build a Pipeline that uses 51Degrees Cloud IP Intelligence from a
 *    resource key.
 * 2. How to list the properties the resource key exposes, with each property's
 *    category and value type. IP-intelligence properties are weighted, so they
 *    are reported as a KeyValueList of value/weight records rather than a plain
 *    scalar type.
 * 3. How to determine which evidence keys the pipeline accepts. The pipeline
 *    evidence filter is the union of every element's filter; the cloud request
 *    engine is the element that forwards evidence to the service, so its keys
 *    dominate. The accepted set depends on the products the resource key enables,
 *    so not every probed key will be relevant to IP Intelligence alone.
 *
 * The property list reflects the resource key, not the full cloud catalogue, so
 * it is the set this particular key returns.
 *
 * This is a console example, so it does not add the ShareUsageElement. A
 * production deployment should enable usage sharing.
 *
 * To run this example, create a Resource Key for free at
 * https://configure.51degrees.com?utm_source=code&utm_medium=example&utm_campaign=rust&utm_content=examples-ip-intelligence-examples-src-bin-ipi-cloud-metadata.rs&utm_term=ipi-cloud-metadata and supply it via the 51DEGREES_RESOURCE_KEY
 * environment variable or as the first command-line argument. By default the
 * pipeline talks to the public cloud endpoint; set the 51DEGREES_CLOUD_ENDPOINT
 * environment variable to point at a self-hosted Cloud service instead.
