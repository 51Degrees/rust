/*
 * @example ipi-cloud-get-all-properties.rs
 *
 * This example shows how to retrieve every IP-intelligence property a resource
 * key returns from the 51Degrees Cloud service, with the weighting on each
 * value.
 *
 * You will learn:
 *
 * 1. How to build a Pipeline that uses 51Degrees Cloud IP Intelligence from a
 *    resource key.
 * 2. How to process an IP address and read the result.
 * 3. How to enumerate every property the result holds through the dynamic
 *    property bag, rather than the fixed set of typed accessors, so the example
 *    prints whatever the resource key returns.
 *
 * IP Intelligence properties are weighted, so each property can carry several
 * candidate values, each with a weighting that says how strongly the data
 * supports it. In the dynamic bag each weighted property appears as a list of
 * value/weight records; this example renders each candidate as
 * `value (weighting w)` so the distribution is visible. Long results are
 * truncated for readability.
 *
 * This is a console example, so it does not add the ShareUsageElement. A
 * production deployment should enable usage sharing.
 *
 * To run this example, create a Resource Key for free at
 * https://configure.51degrees.com?utm_source=code&utm_medium=example&utm_campaign=rust&utm_content=examples-ip-intelligence-examples-src-bin-ipi-cloud-get-all-properties.rs&utm_term=ipi-cloud-get-all-properties and supply it via the 51DEGREES_RESOURCE_KEY
 * environment variable or as the first command-line argument. By default the
 * pipeline talks to the public cloud endpoint; set the 51DEGREES_CLOUD_ENDPOINT
 * environment variable to point at a self-hosted Cloud service instead.
