//! On-premise IP Intelligence data-file update console example.

//! Demonstrates the data-file update mechanisms the on-premise engine exposes:
//! a programmatic reload from disk, the file-system-watcher and automatic-update
//! switches, and how the engine reports its data-file state. The descriptive

/*
 * @example ipi-onprem-update-data-file.rs
 *
 * The on-premise IP Intelligence data-file update example, adapted to the update
 * mechanisms the on-premise engine exposes.
 *
 * It shows how to:
 *
 * 1. Build an on-premise engine and read its data-file state through the
 *    `OnPremiseAspectEngine` trait: the file path, its publish date and any
 *    configured remote update URL.
 * 2. Configure the two automatic update switches, `auto_update` (poll a remote
 *    URL for a newer file) and `file_system_watcher` (reload when the file on
 *    disk changes). They are reported here rather than left running so the
 *    example is self-contained.
 * 3. Trigger a *programmatic* update by calling `refresh`, which reopens the
 *    data file from disk and swaps it in atomically. Concurrent lookups keep
 *    using the previous data set until the swap completes, so this is safe on a
 *    live engine. The example confirms the engine still resolves the same IP
 *    after the reload.
 *
 * # Distributor caveat
 *
 * Automatic daily updates over the network rely on the 51Degrees Distributor
 * service, which is not yet available for IP Intelligence Enterprise data
 * files. Until it is, update the data file by replacing it on disk (optionally
 * with the file-system watcher enabled) or by calling `refresh` as shown.
 *
 * # Data file
 *
 * Resolved by `examples_shared::ipi_data_path`. Contact 51Degrees for an
 * Enterprise file: <https://51degrees.com/contact-us?utm_source=code&utm_medium=example&utm_campaign=rust&utm_content=examples-ip-intelligence-examples-src-bin-ipi-onprem-update-data-file.rs&utm_term=ipi-onprem-update-data-file>.
