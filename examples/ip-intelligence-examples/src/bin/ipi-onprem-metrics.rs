/*
 * @example ipi-onprem-metrics.rs
 *
 * The on-premise IP Intelligence metrics example, adapted to the insight the
 * on-premise engine exposes.
 *
 * Unlike Device Detection, IP Intelligence does not expose match metrics
 * (difference, drift, method, iterations). This example therefore reports, per
 * lookup:
 *
 * 1. The wall-clock time the lookup took, measured around `FlowData::process`.
 * 2. Whether the result was served from a cache.
 * 3. The resolved value of a summary property.
 *
 * The example builds the pipeline with the `HighPerformance` profile. The
 * performance example explores how the other profiles (LowMemory, InMemory,
 * Balanced, Default) trade memory against speed.
 *
 * # Data file
 *
 * Resolved by `examples_shared::ipi_data_path`. Contact 51Degrees for an
 * Enterprise file with the full property set: <https://51degrees.com/contact-us?utm_source=code&utm_medium=example&utm_campaign=rust&utm_content=examples-ip-intelligence-examples-src-bin-ipi-onprem-metrics.rs&utm_term=ipi-onprem-metrics>.
