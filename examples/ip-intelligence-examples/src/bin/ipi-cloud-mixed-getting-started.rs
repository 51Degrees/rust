//! Mixed cloud example: Device Detection and IP Intelligence in one pipeline.
//!
//! Builds a single pipeline that runs both the cloud Device Detection engine and
//! the cloud IP Intelligence engine over one shared cloud request engine, so a
//! User-Agent and a client IP supplied together are resolved in one cloud call.
//! The descriptive block the documentation tooling renders lives at the bottom of
//! the file.

/*
 * @example ipi-cloud-mixed-getting-started.rs
 *
 * This example demonstrates using both Device Detection and IP Intelligence from
 * the 51Degrees cloud service in a single pipeline.
 *
 * You will learn:
 *
 * 1. How to build one Pipeline that runs both 51Degrees Cloud Device Detection
 *    and Cloud IP Intelligence over a single shared CloudRequestEngine, so a
 *    User-Agent and a client IP supplied together are resolved in one cloud call.
 * 2. How to pass both kinds of evidence (a User-Agent under `header.user-agent`
 *    and a client IP under `query.client-ip-51d`) to the pipeline as flow data.
 * 3. How to read the device result (IsMobile, PlatformName, BrowserName,
 *    HardwareVendor) and the IP intelligence result (Country, CountryCode,
 *    RegisteredCountry, RegisteredName, RegisteredOwner) from the one flow data.
 *
 * The single-product cloud facades each build their own pipeline, so this example
 * composes the engines directly: it creates one CloudRequestEngine from the
 * resource key, then builds a DeviceDetectionCloudEngine and an
 * IpIntelligenceCloudEngine that both read from it, and adds all three elements to
 * one Pipeline. Device properties are single-valued; IP intelligence properties
 * are probabilistic, so each is printed as a list of candidate values, each with a
 * weighting (a 0.0..=1.0 multiplier) that says how strongly the data supports it.
 *
 * The example processes five device-and-IP pairings: a UK desktop, a Chinese
 * iPhone, a Chilean desktop, an iPad on an IPv6 address and a US Android device.
 *
 * This is a console example, so it does not add the ShareUsageElement. A
 * production deployment, and every web example, should enable usage sharing so the
 * data behind these results keeps improving.
 *
 * To run this example, create a Resource Key for free at
 * https://configure.51degrees.com?utm_source=code&utm_medium=example&utm_campaign=rust&utm_content=examples-ip-intelligence-examples-src-bin-ipi-cloud-mixed-getting-started.rs&utm_term=ipi-cloud-mixed-getting-started and supply it via the 51DEGREES_RESOURCE_KEY
 * environment variable or as the first command-line argument. The key must grant
 * both the device and IP intelligence products. By default the pipeline talks to
 * the public cloud endpoint; set the 51D_CLOUD_ENDPOINT environment variable to
 * point at a self-hosted Cloud service instead.
