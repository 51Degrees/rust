/*
 * @example ipi-onprem-performance.rs
 *
 * The on-premise IP Intelligence performance example.
 *
 * It shows how to:
 *
 * 1. Build an on-premise IP Intelligence pipeline tuned for throughput with the
 *    `HighPerformance` profile. The other profiles (InMemory, LowMemory,
 *    Balanced, Default) are documented inline so they can be swapped in to
 *    compare their memory/speed trade-offs.
 * 2. Load a set of IP addresses from the evidence file in the data submodule.
 * 3. Run a warm-up pass, then a single-threaded and a multi-threaded timed
 *    pass, looking every IP up through the pipeline. The pipeline is shared
 *    across threads via an `Arc`, demonstrating that the on-premise engine is
 *    safe to use concurrently.
 * 4. Report the headline metrics: total lookups, elapsed time, throughput
 *    (lookups per second) and the mean time per lookup.
