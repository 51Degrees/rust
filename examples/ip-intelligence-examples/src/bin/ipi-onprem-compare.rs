/*
 * @example ipi-onprem-compare.rs
 *
 * The on-premise IP Intelligence compare example, adapted to the ASN data file
 * the workspace bundles.
 *
 * It shows two kinds of comparison:
 *
 * 1. The same IP looked up under several performance profiles
 *    (`HighPerformance`, `LowMemory`, `Balanced`). The profiles trade memory
 *    against speed but must not change the *result*, so the example asserts
 *    they agree. This is a quick way to confirm that a profile change made for
 *    performance reasons has not altered detection.
 * 2. Two IP addresses looked up under one profile and compared against each
 *    other, reporting whether they map to the same autonomous system.
 *
 * Each value is shown as the single plain value the data file resolves.
 *
 * # Data file
