/*
 * @example dd-cloud-getting-started.rs
 *
 * The device-detection cloud getting-started console example. It shows the
 * simplest end-to-end use of the 51Degrees cloud service for device detection.
 *
 * The example builds a cloud pipeline from a resource key with the convenience
 * `DeviceDetectionPipelineBuilder::cloud(resource_key)`. The builder assembles a
 * `CloudRequestEngine` (which makes one HTTP call per flow data to the 51Degrees
 * cloud) followed by a `DeviceDetectionCloudEngine` (which turns the cloud's JSON
 * response into the shared `DeviceData` result). Because the result type and key
 * are identical to the on-premise engine, the result-reading code below is the
 * same whichever deployment produced it.
 *
 * For each representative evidence set (a desktop User-Agent, a mobile
 * User-Agent, a full User-Agent Client Hints header set, and a base64
 * high-entropy `getHighEntropyValues` blob) the example creates a `FlowData`,
 * adds the evidence, processes it, then reads four common device properties back
 * through their strongly-typed accessors:
 *
 * - `IsMobile` (a boolean),
 * - `HardwareVendor` (a string),
 * - `BrowserName` (a string),
 * - `PlatformName` (a string).
 *
 * Each accessor returns an `AspectPropertyValue<T>`, the no-value-aware wrapper
 * the typed getters use. Rather than assuming a value is present, the example
 * prints the value when one is available and the engine's no-value explanation
 * when it is not. If any property is left without a value (usually because the
 * resource key does not grant it) a pricing message is printed once, pointing to
 * the configurator where a key with more properties can be created.
 *
 * Usage sharing is intentionally not enabled here. Console examples must not add
 * the `ShareUsageElement`. A production web deployment should enable usage
 * sharing (call `.share_usage(true)` on the builder) to contribute anonymous
 * usage data, which improves detection for everyone.
 *
 * The resource key is read from the first command-line argument or the
 * `51DEGREES_RESOURCE_KEY` environment variable. Create a free key, or a paid key
 * with the full property set, at https://configure.51degrees.com?utm_source=code&utm_medium=example&utm_campaign=rust&utm_content=examples-device-detection-examples-src-bin-dd-cloud-getting-started.rs&utm_term=dd-cloud-getting-started.
