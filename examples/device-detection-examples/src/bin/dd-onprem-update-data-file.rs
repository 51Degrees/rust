/*
 * @example dd-onprem-update-data-file.rs
 *
 * The device-detection on-premise data-file-update console example. It
 * illustrates the parameters that control when a new on-premise data file is
 * sought and when it is loaded.
 *
 * Four update mechanisms are demonstrated, all driven by the
 * `DataUpdateService`:
 *
 * - Update on start-up. With `update_on_startup(true)` on the data-file
 *   configuration, building the engine blocks while the service polls the
 *   51Degrees distributor once, so the engine starts with the most recent data.
 *   This needs an Enterprise license key and a writable file location.
 * - File-system watcher. With `file_system_watcher_enabled(true)`, the service
 *   watches the data file on disk and reloads the engine whenever the file is
 *   replaced. This is how a file you download and drop into place yourself is
 *   picked up automatically.
 * - Remote-update polling. With `automatic_updates_enabled(true)`, a polling
 *   interval (around 30 minutes in production) and a randomisation window (around
 *   10 minutes, to stagger many instances), the service periodically polls the
 *   distributor URL with an `If-Modified-Since` header and applies any newer
 *   file. This needs an Enterprise license key.
 * - Programmatic update. `DataUpdateService::check_for_update` forces an immediate
 *   check on demand, and `OnPremiseAspectEngine::refresh` reloads from disk
 *   directly, which is useful after placing a file yourself or on an external
 *   trigger.
 *
 * The example builds an engine wired to a `DataUpdateService` with the watcher
 * and polling configured (but update-on-startup off, so building does not block),
 * then exercises the two no-network paths for real against the supplied file: a
 * programmatic `check_for_update` (which, with no remote URL on the Lite file,
 * refreshes from the file on disk) and a direct `engine.refresh(None)`. Both
 * hot-swap a freshly read data set while in-flight detections keep using the data
 * set they snapshotted.
 *
 * The shipped Lite data file cannot actually be auto-updated: automatic updates
 * require an Enterprise license and a downloadable file. So with no license key
 * the example documents the wiring and runs only the safe no-network paths. Supply
 * a key (second argument or the `51DEGREES_LICENSE_KEY` environment variable) and
 * point at an Enterprise file to perform a real download. An Enterprise license is
 * available from https://51degrees.com/pricing?utm_source=code&utm_medium=example&utm_campaign=rust&utm_content=examples-device-detection-examples-src-bin-dd-onprem-update-data-file.rs&utm_term=dd-onprem-update-data-file.
 *
 * The data file is read from the first command-line argument, the
 * `51DEGREES_DD_PATH` environment variable, or the Lite Hash file shipped in the
 * device-detection-cxx submodule.
