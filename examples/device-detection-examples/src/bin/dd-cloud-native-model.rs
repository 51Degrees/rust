/*
 * @example dd-cloud-native-model.rs
 *
 * The device-detection cloud native-model lookup console example. It shows how
 * to use the 51Degrees cloud to look up the devices associated with a given
 * native model name, the identifier a device reports about itself. On Android
 * this is the value of `android.os.Build.MODEL`; on iOS it is the machine name
 * (for example `iPhone11,8`).
 *
 * As with a TAC, a native model name can match several device profiles. The
 * pipeline carries a `HardwareProfileCloudEngine` (the same engine the TAC
 * example uses; the two are the two use-cases of the hardware-profile lookup),
 * which parses the cloud response's `hardware.profiles` array into a
 * `MultiDeviceData`. The example reads the matches back through
 * `HARDWARE_DATA_KEY` and prints each as a `Vendor Name (Model)` line.
 *
 * The native model name is an input-only value: it is supplied as
 * `query.nativemodel` evidence and is never returned in the response.
 *
 * Native model lookup requires a resource key with the hardware-profile-lookup
 * product (a paid subscription). A key without it returns the standard
 * single-device `device` block with no `hardware.profiles`, so the lookup yields
 * no profiles and the example reports that. The example's test is therefore
 * ignored by default, so a plain `cargo test` stays green offline, and it skips
 * cleanly when no resource key is set.
 *
 * No `ShareUsageElement` is added, because this is a console example. A
 * production web deployment should enable usage sharing.
 *
 * The resource key is read from the first command-line argument or the
 * `51DEGREES_RESOURCE_KEY` environment variable. See https://51degrees.com/pricing?utm_source=code&utm_medium=example&utm_campaign=rust&utm_content=examples-device-detection-examples-src-bin-dd-cloud-native-model.rs&utm_term=dd-cloud-native-model
 * for a paid subscription and https://configure.51degrees.com?utm_source=code&utm_medium=example&utm_campaign=rust&utm_content=examples-device-detection-examples-src-bin-dd-cloud-native-model.rs&utm_term=dd-cloud-native-model to create a key.
