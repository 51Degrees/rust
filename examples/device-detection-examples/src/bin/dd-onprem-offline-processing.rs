/*
 * @example dd-onprem-offline-processing.rs
 *
 * The device-detection on-premise offline-processing console example. It shows
 * batch processing of a YAML file of evidence.
 *
 * The bundled "20000 Evidence Records.yml" file holds 20,000 records of evidence
 * representing HTTP headers, for example:
 *
 *   header.user-agent: 'Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) ...'
 *   header.sec-ch-ua-mobile: '?0'
 *   header.sec-ch-ua-platform: '"Windows"'
 *
 * The example builds an on-premise pipeline once, then streams the multi-document
 * YAML file one record at a time. For each record it creates a `FlowData`, adds
 * the record's evidence, processes it, and reads the detected properties back
 * through the shared helpers. It writes the input evidence together with the
 * detected `device.*` properties (IsMobile, PlatformName, PlatformVersion,
 * BrowserName, BrowserVersion and DeviceId) to a YAML output file, one document
 * per record.
 *
 * Storing the `DeviceId` alongside each record is deliberate: a device id is a
 * stable identifier for the detected combination of hardware, OS, browser and
 * crawler, so a later run can skip detection by supplying the id under the
 * `query.51D_deviceId` evidence key, which is faster and yields the same result
 * even as detection improves over time.
 *
 * Only the properties available in the free Lite data tier are read here. Further
 * fields (hardware vendor, model and name) are available with a paid Enterprise
 * data file and can be added in the same way.
 *
 * Usage sharing is intentionally not enabled. Console examples must not add the
 * `ShareUsageElement`, and in general off-line processing usage should not be
 * shared back to 51Degrees because it lacks the full evidence the data back-end
 * needs and would be discarded. A production web deployment should enable usage
 * sharing with `.share_usage(true)`.
 *
 * The data and evidence files are read from the first two command-line arguments,
 * the `51DEGREES_DD_PATH` environment variable, or the files shipped in the
 * device-detection-cxx submodule. The output file defaults to
 * `dd-offline-processing-output.yml` next to the evidence file, or the third
 * command-line argument.
 *
 * For experimenting with the performance/accuracy trade-off, change the
 * `PerformanceProfile` passed to the builder (for example MaxPerformance,
 * LowMemory or Balanced); the performance example explores these in depth.
