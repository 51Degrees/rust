/*
 * @example dd-onprem-match-metrics.rs
 *
 * The device-detection on-premise match-metrics console example.
 *
 * On-premise detection provides metrics that give insight into the detection
 * process and the confidence in the result. After processing a sample User-Agent
 * the example prints, through the strongly-typed accessors:
 *
 * - `DeviceId`     - the four hyphen-separated profile ids identifying the
 *                    detected hardware / platform / browser / crawler combination,
 * - `MatchedNodes` - the number of hash nodes matched within the evidence,
 * - `Difference`   - how far the matched substrings were from the expected values
 *                    (larger means less confident),
 * - `Drift`        - the total difference in character positions where substring
 *                    hashes were found versus expected,
 * - `Iterations`   - the number of graph nodes visited to find the match,
 * - `Method`       - the algorithm used, for example Exact or Performance.
 *
 * Each metric is an `AspectPropertyValue<T>`, so the example prints the value
 * when present and the engine's no-value explanation otherwise. The match metrics
 * are pseudo-properties the Hash engine advertises in addition to the data-file
 * properties. The DeviceId is always produced for a match; a numeric metric is
 * shown only when the loaded data set supplies a value for it, and otherwise
 * reported as a no-value rather than fabricated.
 *
 * A key point of this example is that reducing the number of properties requested
 * reduces the time taken for detection, because the engine resolves fewer
 * components. To make that concrete the example builds two pipelines over the
 * same data file, one restricted to a single hardware property (`IsMobile`) and
 * one returning every property the data tier supports, then times the same
 * detection through each and reports the per-detection time. The single-property
 * engine is the faster of the two.
 *
 * The example prints the data file's tier and publish date and the standard
 * warnings (Lite tier has a small number of properties and limited accuracy; a
 * file more than 30 days old may miss the latest devices). For a discussion of
 * metrics and data-set production see
 * https://51degrees.com/documentation/_device_detection__hash.html?utm_source=code&utm_medium=example&utm_campaign=rust&utm_content=examples-device-detection-examples-src-bin-dd-onprem-match-metrics.rs&utm_term=dd-onprem-match-metrics and the
 * performance-options page.
 *
 * Usage sharing is intentionally not enabled here. Console examples must not add
 * the `ShareUsageElement`. A production web deployment should enable usage
 * sharing with `.share_usage(true)`.
 *
 * The data file is read from the first command-line argument, the
 * `51DEGREES_DD_PATH` environment variable, or the Lite Hash file shipped in the
 * device-detection-cxx submodule.
