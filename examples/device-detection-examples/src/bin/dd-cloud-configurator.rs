/*
 * @example dd-cloud-configurator.rs
 *
 * The device-detection cloud configurator console example. It illustrates how a
 * resource key created in the 51Degrees configurator (https://configure.51degrees.com?utm_source=code&utm_medium=example&utm_campaign=rust&utm_content=examples-device-detection-examples-src-bin-dd-cloud-configurator.rs&utm_term=dd-cloud-configurator) is
 * turned into a configured, ready-to-run cloud pipeline.
 *
 * The configurator lets you choose exactly which properties a key returns and,
 * optionally, lock the key to one or more request origins. This example makes
 * that configuration explicit by building the pipeline by hand rather than
 * through the convenience builder:
 *
 * - a `CloudRequestEngine` is built with the resource key (and, if overridden,
 *   the cloud endpoint), and with the cloud request origin set so the `Origin`
 *   header the cloud checks matches the key's allowed origins,
 * - a `DeviceDetectionCloudEngine` is built on top of it to turn the cloud's
 *   JSON response into the shared `DeviceData` result,
 * - the two are added to a `Pipeline` in order.
 *
 * The convenience `DeviceDetectionPipelineBuilder::cloud(resource_key)` performs
 * the same wiring for the common case, but it does not expose the request
 * origin, which is the piece this example exists to show.
 *
 * A single User-Agent Client Hints detection is then run through the pipeline
 * and `IsMobile` is printed, with the no-value case handled explicitly. The
 * sample origin (`www.51degrees-example.com`) is only accepted by the cloud if
 * the resource key is locked to it, so the live test sends no origin for a
 * generic key.
 *
 * No `ShareUsageElement` is added, because this is a console example. A
 * production web deployment should enable usage sharing.
 *
 * The resource key is read from the first command-line argument or the
 * `51DEGREES_RESOURCE_KEY` environment variable.
