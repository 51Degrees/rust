/*
 * @example dd-web-getting-started-cloud.rs
 *
 * Device Detection cloud web example (server-side plus client-side).
 *
 * This example demonstrates the 51Degrees Pipeline performing device detection
 * in the cloud inside a small axum web server. It shows three things working
 * together:
 *
 *   1. Server-side detection. The 51Degrees middleware (installed by
 *      `register`) runs the pipeline for the incoming request and stores the
 *      result. The home-page handler reads it through the `FiftyOneResult`
 *      extractor and renders a properties table.
 *
 *   2. The Accept-CH handshake. The set-headers element asks the browser for
 *      User-Agent Client Hints by adding an `Accept-CH` response header. The
 *      page shows the response headers and warns (a `c-eg-alert`) when no
 *      `Accept-CH` was emitted, which usually means the browser does not support
 *      client hints.
 *
 *   3. Client-side refinement. The page loads `/51Degrees.core.js` (mounted by
 *      `register`) which gathers high-entropy client evidence and posts it back
 *      to `/51dpipeline/json`. The shared `examples.min.js` helper subscribes to
 *      the resulting `complete` event and appends a refreshed results table into
 *      `#content`, so Apple models and screen dimensions become available.
 *
 * Usage sharing is enabled (`.share_usage(true)`), which web deployments are
 * expected to do so anonymous evidence improves detection for everyone. The
 * console examples in this crate deliberately leave it off.
 *
 * The page is written to the shared 51Degrees example design system: it
 * references the vendored `examples-main.min.css` and `examples.min.js`
 * (embedded in the binary and served from `/static/...`) and uses the `.c-eg-*`
 * class contract for the results, evidence and response-header tables and the
 * `c-eg-message` contact-us banner.
 *
 * Build a resource key at https://configure.51degrees.com?utm_source=code&utm_medium=example&utm_campaign=rust&utm_content=examples-device-detection-examples-src-bin-dd-web-getting-started-cloud.rs&utm_term=dd-web-getting-started-cloud and export it as
 * `51DEGREES_RESOURCE_KEY`, then run the binary and open http://127.0.0.1:8080.
