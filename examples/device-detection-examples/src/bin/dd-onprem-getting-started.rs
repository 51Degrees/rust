/*
 * @example dd-onprem-getting-started.rs
 *
 * The device-detection on-premise getting-started console example. It shows the
 * simplest end-to-end use of the native Hash engine for device detection.
 *
 * The example builds an on-premise pipeline from a Hash data file with the
 * convenience `DeviceDetectionPipelineBuilder::on_premise(data_file)`. The builder
 * places an optional UA-CH high-entropy decoder before the native Hash engine,
 * with usage sharing off. The pipeline is built once and reused as a factory for
 * many `FlowData` instances, which is the recommended lifecycle: one long-lived
 * pipeline (often a process-wide singleton) and a short-lived flow data per
 * request.
 *
 * For each representative evidence set (a desktop User-Agent and a mobile
 * User-Agent) the example creates a `FlowData`, adds the evidence, processes it,
 * then reads common device properties back through their strongly-typed accessors:
 *
 * - `IsMobile` (a boolean),
 * - `PlatformName` and `PlatformVersion` (strings),
 * - `BrowserName` and `BrowserVersion` (strings),
 * - `DeviceId` (a string, the four hyphen-separated profile ids).
 *
 * Each accessor returns an `AspectPropertyValue<T>`, the no-value-aware wrapper
 * the typed getters use. Rather than assuming a value is present, the example
 * prints the value when one is available and the engine's no-value explanation
 * when it is not.
 *
 * The example also points out that on-premise detection exposes match metrics
 * (MatchedNodes, Difference, Drift, Iterations, Method) describing how a result
 * was reached. Those are demonstrated in the dd-onprem-match-metrics example.
 *
 * Finally the example prints the data file's tier and publish date and the
 * standard warnings: the shipped Lite file has a small number of properties and
 * limited accuracy, and a file more than 30 days old may miss the latest devices.
 * The Enterprise file (with automatic daily updates) is described on the
 * 51Degrees pricing page.
 *
 * Usage sharing is intentionally not enabled here. Console examples must not add
 * the `ShareUsageElement`. A production web deployment should enable usage sharing
 * (call `.share_usage(true)` on the builder) to contribute anonymous usage data,
 * which improves detection for everyone.
 *
 * The data file is read from the first command-line argument, the
 * `51DEGREES_DD_PATH` environment variable, or the Lite Hash file shipped in the
 * device-detection-cxx submodule. The Lite file is free; the Enterprise file with
 * the full property set is described at https://51degrees.com/pricing?utm_source=code&utm_medium=example&utm_campaign=rust&utm_content=examples-device-detection-examples-src-bin-dd-onprem-getting-started.rs&utm_term=dd-onprem-getting-started.
