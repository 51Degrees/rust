/*
 * @example dd-cloud-metadata.rs
 *
 * The device-detection cloud metadata console example. It shows how to
 * discover, at runtime, which device properties a resource key grants and which
 * evidence keys the cloud will accept for it.
 *
 * Two different engines own the two kinds of metadata, and the example reads
 * each from the right place:
 *
 * - The list of device properties comes from the `DeviceDetectionCloudEngine`.
 *   That list is not known until the cloud has been asked for the resource key's
 *   accessible properties, which happens lazily on first use. The example forces
 *   that discovery up front by calling `refresh_properties`, which makes one
 *   cloud request and returns the number of properties found. Each property is
 *   then printed with its category and core value type.
 *
 * - The list of accepted evidence keys comes from the `CloudRequestEngine`, not
 *   the device engine. The device engine consumes no raw evidence of its own. It
 *   simply processes the JSON the request engine fetches. The request engine is
 *   the element that takes the evidence values and sends them to the cloud, so
 *   it is the one that advertises which keys are accepted. When the engine's
 *   evidence filter is an enumerable whitelist the keys are listed. Otherwise
 *   the example falls back to probing a single key for inclusion.
 *
 * No `ShareUsageElement` is added, because this is a console example. A
 * production web deployment should enable usage sharing.
 *
 * The resource key is read from the first command-line argument or the
 * `51DEGREES_RESOURCE_KEY` environment variable. Create a free key, or a paid key
 * with the full property set, at https://configure.51degrees.com?utm_source=code&utm_medium=example&utm_campaign=rust&utm_content=examples-device-detection-examples-src-bin-dd-cloud-metadata.rs&utm_term=dd-cloud-metadata.
