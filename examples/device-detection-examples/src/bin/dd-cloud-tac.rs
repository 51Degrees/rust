/*
 * @example dd-cloud-tac.rs
 *
 * The device-detection cloud TAC-lookup console example. It shows how to use
 * the 51Degrees cloud to look up the devices associated with a given Type
 * Allocation Code (TAC). Background on TACs is at
 * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_Allocation_Code.
 *
 * A TAC identifies a class of device, so a single lookup can match more than one
 * device profile. The pipeline carries a `HardwareProfileCloudEngine`, which
 * parses the cloud response's `hardware.profiles` array into a
 * `MultiDeviceData`. The example reads the matches back through
 * `HARDWARE_DATA_KEY` and prints each as a `Vendor Name (Model)` line, using the
 * same typed accessors as single-device detection.
 *
 * TAC is an input-only property, supplied as `query.tac` evidence and never
 * returned in the response. The TAC is added as evidence and the resulting
 * profiles are read back.
 *
 * TAC lookup requires a resource key with the hardware-profile-lookup product (a
 * paid subscription). A key without it returns the standard single-device
 * `device` block with no `hardware.profiles`, so the lookup yields no profiles
 * and the example reports that. The example's test is therefore ignored by
 * default, so a plain `cargo test` stays green offline, and it skips cleanly when
 * no resource key is set.
 *
 * No `ShareUsageElement` is added, because this is a console example. A
 * production web deployment should enable usage sharing.
 *
 * The resource key is read from the first command-line argument or the
 * `51DEGREES_RESOURCE_KEY` environment variable. See https://51degrees.com/pricing?utm_source=code&utm_medium=example&utm_campaign=rust&utm_content=examples-device-detection-examples-src-bin-dd-cloud-tac.rs&utm_term=dd-cloud-tac
 * for a paid subscription and https://configure.51degrees.com?utm_source=code&utm_medium=example&utm_campaign=rust&utm_content=examples-device-detection-examples-src-bin-dd-cloud-tac.rs&utm_term=dd-cloud-tac to create a key.
