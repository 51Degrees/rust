//! Build script for the device-detection examples.
//!
//! Its only job is a Windows-specific fix. On the MSVC toolchain the Windows
//! "installer-detection" heuristic forces an elevation (UAC) prompt for any
//! executable whose file name contains words such as "update", "setup",
//! "install" or "patch". One example bin is named `dd-onprem-update-data-file`,
//! so without an application manifest Windows refuses to launch it from a
//! non-elevated context (and `cargo test` fails with OS error 740, "requires
//! elevation"). Embedding a manifest that declares `requestedExecutionLevel
//! level="asInvoker"` tells Windows not to apply the heuristic, so every example
//! bin runs as an ordinary user process. This affects only how the executables
//! are launched on Windows; it changes no behavior and no example code.
//!
//! The manifest is embedded straight by the MSVC linker (`link.exe`), so the
//! build needs no extra crates. On every other target the script does nothing.
