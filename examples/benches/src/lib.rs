//! # 51Degrees example benchmarks
//!
//! Criterion micro-benchmarks that guard the throughput and render budgets the
//! Device Detection and IP Intelligence specifications call for. They are
//! expressed as repeatable Criterion benches so a regression shows up as a
//! measured slowdown rather than as eyeballing console output.
//!
//! The crate holds no library code of its own. Its targets are the three benches
//! under `benches/`, each a self-contained file wired with `harness = false`:
//!
//! - `dd_onprem_throughput`. On-premise Device Detection over the bundled
//!   "20000 Evidence Records.yml" against the Lite `.hash` file, reporting
//!   detections per second.
//! - `ipi_onprem_throughput`. On-premise IP Intelligence lookups over the bundled
//!   `evidence.yml` against the 4.5 ASN `.ipi` file, reporting lookups per second.
//! - `javascript_builder_render`. The JavaScript-builder template render time,
//!   with the minify path measured too when the `minify` feature is enabled.
//!
//! Every bench resolves its inputs through [`examples_shared`] and skips itself
//! cleanly (registering no Criterion benchmark) when an input is missing, so a
//! plain `cargo bench` is safe to run in a checkout without the data submodules
//! or the production data share.
