/*
 * @example ipi_onprem_throughput.rs
 *
 * The on-premise IP Intelligence lookup-throughput benchmark. It is the Criterion
 * counterpart of the `ipi-onprem-performance` console example, expressed as a
 * repeatable benchmark so a throughput regression is caught as a measured
 * slowdown.
 *
 * What it measures
 *
 * It loads a few hundred client-IP addresses from the bundled `evidence.yml`,
 * builds one on-premise pipeline tuned for speed against the 4.5 ASN `.ipi` file,
 * then times looking every IP up. Criterion is told the element count per
 * iteration via `Throughput::Elements`, so it reports lookups per second.
 *
 * Configuration choices that maximise and stabilise the figure:
 *
 * - The `HighPerformance` profile holds the data set in memory for the fastest
 *   lookups. The other profiles (InMemory, LowMemory, Balanced, Default) trade
 *   memory for speed. Swap the profile in `build_pipeline` to compare them.
 * - A single requested property (`Asn`) keeps the lookup minimal. The result is
 *   read behind `black_box` so the optimiser cannot remove the work.
 * - Auto-update and the file-system watcher are disabled so no background thread
 *   perturbs the timing.
 *
 * Why the ASN tier
 *
 * The bench forces `IpiTier::Asn`: the ASN file is the small, current,
 * always-loadable 4.5 file. The shipped Lite file is format 4.4 and rejected by
 * the current native library, and the Enterprise file lives on a network share
 * reachable only inside 51Degrees, so ASN is the reproducible target.
 *
 * Usage sharing is intentionally not enabled, as this is a benchmark tool.
 *
 * Data is resolved through `examples_shared` (the ASN file via `ipi_data_path`,
 * the evidence file via `find_file`). When either is missing the benchmark
 * registers nothing and exits cleanly, so `cargo bench` is safe to run without
 * the data submodules.
