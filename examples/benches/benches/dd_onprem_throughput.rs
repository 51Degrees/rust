/*
 * @example dd_onprem_throughput.rs
 *
 * The on-premise Device Detection detection-throughput benchmark. It is the
 * Criterion counterpart of the `dd-onprem-performance` console example,
 * expressed as a repeatable benchmark so a throughput regression shows up as a
 * measured slowdown.
 *
 * What it measures
 *
 * It loads a few hundred evidence records from the bundled
 * "20000 Evidence Records.yml" (a mix of plain User-Agents and User-Agent Client
 * Hints), builds one on-premise pipeline tuned for speed, then times running a
 * detection over every record. Criterion is told the element count per iteration
 * via `Throughput::Elements`, so it reports detections per second alongside the
 * per-iteration time.
 *
 * Two deliberate choices maximise and stabilise the figure:
 *
 * - The `HighPerformance` profile holds the data set in memory for the fastest
 *   detections. The other profiles (Balanced, LowMemory and so on) trade memory
 *   for speed. Swap the profile in `build_pipeline` to compare the options.
 * - A single requested property (`IsMobile`) means detection resolves one
 *   component, the fastest realistic configuration. A property is read on each
 *   detection, behind `black_box`, so the optimiser cannot remove the work.
 *
 * Usage sharing is intentionally not enabled: the `ShareUsageElement` is omitted,
 * as it must be for console and offline tooling, and would otherwise add network
 * work unrelated to the measurement. A production web deployment should enable it.
 *
 * Data is resolved through `examples_shared` (the Lite .hash via `dd_data_path`,
 * the evidence file via `find_file`). When either is missing the benchmark
 * registers nothing and exits cleanly, so `cargo bench` is safe to run without
 * the data submodules. See
 * https://51degrees.com/documentation/_device_detection__features__performance_options.html?utm_source=code&utm_medium=example&utm_campaign=rust&utm_content=examples-benches-benches-dd_onprem_throughput.rs&utm_term=header
