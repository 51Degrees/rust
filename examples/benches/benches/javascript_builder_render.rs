/*
 * @example javascript_builder_render.rs
 *
 * The JavaScript-builder template-render benchmark. It guards the template-render
 * budget the pipeline specification calls for, so a regression in the Mustache
 * render (or, under the `minify` feature, the minify path) shows up as a measured
 * slowdown rather than slipping by unnoticed.
 *
 * What it measures
 *
 * It assembles the same pipeline a real client-side integration uses, the JSON
 * builder feeding the JavaScript builder, then times one full render: processing
 * a flow data and reading back the generated JavaScript. The flow data carries a
 * host header so the callback URL and the update mechanism are emitted, which
 * exercises the fuller template path rather than the trivial no-URL case.
 *
 * Two benchmarks, gated by feature
 *
 * - `render`. The default, unminified render. Always measured.
 * - `render_minified`. The minify path, compiled in and measured only when the
 *   crate's `minify` feature is enabled (run `cargo bench -p examples-benches
 *   --features minify`). Without the feature the element falls back to the
 *   unminified output, so benchmarking the minify arm then would just measure the
 *   same render twice, which the `#[cfg(feature = "minify")]` gate avoids.
 *
 * The rendered length is read behind `black_box` on every iteration so the
 * compiler cannot elide the render being measured.
 *
 * This benchmark needs no data files, so it always runs. It depends on the
 * JavaScript builder directly because that element is not surfaced through either
 * detection facade.
