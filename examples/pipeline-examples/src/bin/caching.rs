/* ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Example: Caching (a result cache for an engine)
 *
 * This example gives an engine a result cache, so repeated requests with
 * equivalent evidence are served from memory instead of recomputed. Caching is
 * most valuable in front of an expensive engine, above all the cloud request
 * engine, where a cache hit avoids a network round trip entirely.
 *
 * What it shows
 * -------------
 *   1. Holding a `DataKeyedCache` inside an engine. The cache is constructed from
 *      a `CacheBuilder` (which sets the total size and the shard count) and the
 *      engine's evidence-key filter. Using the engine's own filter means the
 *      cache key is derived only from the evidence the engine actually reads.
 *
 *   2. The get-or-compute pattern in `process`: look the request up in the cache;
 *      on a hit reuse the stored result; on a miss compute it (here a trivial
 *      table lookup, in production the expensive work) and store it. The example
 *      counts computations so it can report how many requests the cache served.
 *
 *   3. Deterministic keys. The cache derives its key from the relevant evidence
 *      in a fixed order with case-insensitive names, so two requests that differ
 *      only in evidence ordering or key casing still share one entry.
 *
 * What gets cached
 * ----------------
 * The cached value must be `Send + Sync + Clone`. This example caches the sign
 * string directly. A real engine caches a thread-safe handle to its aspect data
 * (typically an `Arc` around the data struct) because element data itself is not
 * `Sync`, then rebuilds or shares its element data from the cached handle on a
 * hit.
 *
 * Eviction
 * --------
 * The cache is a sharded least-recently-used cache: once a shard is full it
 * evicts its least-recently-used entry, so memory stays bounded. The size is set
 * through the options.
 *
 * Usage sharing
 * -------------
 * This is a console example and does NOT add usage sharing; a production
 * deployment should (see the `usage-sharing` example).
 *
 * Running it
 * ----------
 *   cargo run -p pipeline-examples --bin caching
 *
 * It processes two dates twice and reports that two of the four requests were
 * served from the cache.
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------------- */
