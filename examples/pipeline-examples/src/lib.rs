//! Runnable pipeline examples.
//!
//! The example binaries live in `src/bin/` and are auto-discovered by Cargo, so
//! each is fully self-contained and they can be added independently without
//! touching this file. The handful of pieces every star-sign example needs (the
//! star-sign element data type, the boundary table and the date parsing) are
//! gathered here in [`star_sign`] so the bins share one tested implementation
//! rather than copying it six times.
//!
//! The examples implement the core flow-element demonstrations the
//! [pipeline specification](https://github.com/51Degrees/specifications/blob/main/pipeline-specification/required-examples.md)
//! requires: determining a star sign from a birth date with hard-coded logic, an
//! on-premise data file, client-side JavaScript evidence and a cloud service,
//! plus the usage-sharing and caching feature examples.
