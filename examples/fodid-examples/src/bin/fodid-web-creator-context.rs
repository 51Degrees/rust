//! @page fodid-web-creator-context-example Creator Context (51Did, Web)
//!
//! 51Did web example: the creator context and its two-step verification.
//!
//! Every 51Did the 51Degrees cloud issues carries a creator context, which
//! binds the identifier to the browser and connection it was created on. This
//! demo serves a page that runs the full flow the way production does, in
//! three steps.
//!
//! 1. Create. The browser calls the cloud `json` endpoint, which issues a
//!    51Did for the calling connection.
//! 2. Verify. The browser calls `verify-full`, so the cloud observes the
//!    browser's live connection. The answer is only an encrypted `result`
//!    that the browser can neither read nor forge, with the signature
//!    outcome and the creator context verdict sealed inside it.
//! 3. Redeem. The page hands the encrypted result to this server, which
//!    parses the 51Did, checks its signature offline against the cloud's
//!    public key for its date, then calls `redeem` with the 51Did, the
//!    encrypted result and the account's licence key, and receives the
//!    signature outcome, the true creator context verdict, when the
//!    verification happened (`verifiedAt`) and how long ago that was
//!    (`secondsSinceVerified`).
//!
//! Step 3 is the `fodid` crate's cloud client, `DidClient`, so the server
//! writes no HTTP or key handling of its own.
//!
//! The licence key lives on this server and only here. The browser never sees
//! it. A fresh single-use challenge is issued per page load and bound through
//! both verification steps by the cloud. A production server would also
//! remember the value it issued and reject a redemption carrying any other,
//! which this demo keeps out of scope.
//!
//! What a run costs. Every call the page or this server makes to the cloud is
//! one use against the subscription behind the resource key. A browser
//! checking a 51Did makes two, `verify-full` from the page and `redeem` from
//! this server, so a browser-based context check is two uses every time. The
//! offline signature check costs nothing per identifier, because the public
//! keys are fetched once and cached.
//!
//! Environment: `_51DEGREES_RESOURCE_KEY` is required (the CI names
//! `_51DEGREES_RESOURCE_KEY_BESPOKE` and `_51DEGREES_RESOURCE_KEY_BASIC` are
//! read after it), `_51DEGREES_LICENSE_KEY` is optional,
//! `_51DEGREES_CLOUD_ENDPOINT` overrides the cloud API base and `PORT`
//! overrides the default port of 5100.
//!
//! Run with `cargo run -p fodid-examples --bin fodid-web-creator-context` and
//! open <http://localhost:5100/>.

/*
 * @example fodid-web-creator-context.rs
 *
 * 51Did creator context web example (browser plus server side).
 *
 * This example demonstrates the creator context every 51Did carries and its
 * two-step verification, inside a small axum web server. It shows three
 * things working together:
 *
 *   1. Creation in the browser. The page calls the cloud `json` endpoint,
 *      which issues a 51Did for the browser's own connection and returns
 *      every kind of identifier at once, shown in a table.
 *
 *   2. Verification in the browser. The page calls `verify-full`, so the
 *      cloud observes the browser's live connection. The answer is only an
 *      encrypted result the browser cannot read or forge, with the signature
 *      outcome and the creator context verdict sealed inside it.
 *
 *   3. Redemption on this server. The page hands the encrypted result to
 *      `/redeem`, and this server uses the `fodid` crate's cloud client to
 *      parse the 51Did, check its signature offline, and call the cloud
 *      `redeem` endpoint with the account's licence key, which the browser
 *      never sees, returning the signature outcome and the true context
 *      verdict to the page.
 *
 * Once the 51Did has fully validated, the page offers a link carrying the
 * same identifier. Opened in a different browser, the signature still
 * verifies because the identifier is genuine, but the creator context does
 * not validate, because the context binds the identifier to the browser and
 * connection it was created on. That visible failure is the demonstration, a
 * copied or stolen identifier caught at presentation with nothing stored
 * server side.
 *
 * The page is written to the shared 51Degrees example design system. It
 * references the vendored `examples-main.min.css`, embedded in the
 * `examples-web-shared` crate and served at the page's relative URL. It uses
 * the `.c-eg-*` class contract. The server adds a "Find out more" section
 * before the page's closing body tag, so the page file stays the same as
 * every other language's copy.
 *
 * Build a resource key at https://51degrees.com/configure?utm_source=code&utm_medium=example&utm_campaign=51degrees-rust&utm_content=examples-fodid-examples-src-bin-fodid-web-creator-context.rs&utm_term=fodid-web-creator-context and export it as
 * `_51DEGREES_RESOURCE_KEY`, then run the binary and open http://localhost:5100/.
