//! Property name lookups on a shared Device Detection manager must add up
//! across threads. Every property read resolves its name through
//! `Manager::required_property_index`, so a lock on that path makes threads
//! queue on one another and total throughput falls as threads are added.
//!
//! This is its own test binary so no other test competes for the CPU while it
//! measures. It needs the Lite Hash data file and skips when the file is
//! absent or the machine has a single CPU. It also skips in an unoptimised
//! build, where hashing the name costs so much more than the lock that a
//! shared lock still lets four threads do more than one. Run it with
//! `cargo test --release -p fiftyone-native --test lookup_scaling`, as the
//! pull request workflow does.
