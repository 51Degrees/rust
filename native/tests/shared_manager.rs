//! A manager shared by more threads than its data set has file handles
//! serves every one of them.
//!
//! A data set that reads from its file after it is loaded holds a fixed pool
//! of file handles. Each test shares one opened with the `LowMemory` profile,
//! which reads everything from the file, across more threads than the pool
//! holds. The IP Intelligence library ends the process when a read of a
//! property's values finds no free handle, so a failure of that test shows
//! as this test binary exiting rather than as a failed assertion.
