//! Reading IP Intelligence values leaves no native memory allocated.
//!
//! The test counts the native library's allocations by switching it to its
//! tracking allocator, which every test in the same process would share. It
//! is therefore the only test in this file, and it switches tracking on
//! before the native library allocates anything, because the tracking free
//! refuses memory it did not record.
