//! Safe RAII wrappers over the native Hash device detection engine.
//!
//! [`Manager`] owns a native resource manager loaded from a Hash data file and
//! frees it on drop. [`Results`] owns a native results structure, holds an
//! [`Arc`] to the manager so the data set cannot be freed while results exist,
//! and frees the results on drop. Property name to required-property-index
//! resolution is computed once per manager and cached, and values are read into
//! a reusable per-thread buffer.
//!
//! # Thread safety
//!
//! The native resource manager is internally reference counted and lock
//! protected (see `common-cxx/resource.h`), so a [`Manager`] is both [`Send`]
//! and [`Sync`] and a single one may be shared across threads behind an
//! [`Arc`]. A native results structure is per-thread scratch, so [`Results`] is
//! [`Send`] (it may be moved to another thread) but not [`Sync`] (it must not be
//! used from two threads at once). This matches the pipeline rule that one flow
//! data, and therefore one results structure, belongs to a single thread at a
//! time.
