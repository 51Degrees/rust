//! Safe RAII wrappers over the native IP Intelligence engine.
//!
//! Mirrors the Device Detection wrappers in [`crate::dd`]. [`Manager`] owns a
//! native IP Intelligence resource manager loaded from an `.ipi` data file and
//! frees it on drop. [`Results`] owns a native results structure, holds an
//! [`Arc`] to the manager so the data set stays loaded, and frees the results
//! on drop.
//!
//! [`Results::process_evidence`] looks up the client IP through the native
//! evidence entry point. It reads the evidence keys the data file defines, in
//! the order the native lookup tries them, and passes on every value it can
//! read as an IP address. The engine links its own copy of the shared
//! `common-cxx` sources built with wide file offsets, which is ABI incompatible
//! with the copy `fiftyone-common-sys` builds, so the native evidence array is
//! made with that copy's functions in `fiftyone-ip-intelligence-sys`. Values are
//! read by name into the same reusable per-thread buffer the Device Detection
//! wrapper uses.
//!
//! IP Intelligence values are inherently weighted: a property may resolve to
//! several candidate values, each with a confidence weighting.
//! [`Results::value_as_string`] flattens those to a single separated string,
//! whereas [`Results::values_weighted`] returns each candidate paired with its
//! raw `u16` weighting (highest first), which the Phase 3 on-premise engine
//! surfaces as `AspectPropertyValue<Vec<WeightedValue<T>>>`.
//!
//! # Thread safety
//!
//! As for Device Detection, [`Manager`] is [`Send`] and [`Sync`] (the native
//! manager is reference counted and lock protected) and [`Results`] is [`Send`]
//! but not [`Sync`] (per-thread scratch).
