//! [![51Degrees](https://51degrees.com/img/logo.png?utm_source=github&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=rust&utm_content=fiftyone-native-lib.rs&utm_term=logo "Data rewards the curious")](https://51degrees.com/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=rust&utm_content=fiftyone-native-lib.rs&utm_term=logo)
//!
//! Safe RAII wrapper over the native on-premise engines.
//!
//! This crate is the single safe boundary over the three raw FFI crates
//! ([`fiftyone_common_sys`], [`fiftyone_device_detection_sys`] and
//! [`fiftyone_ip_intelligence_sys`]). It turns the manual, unchecked native
//! life cycle (initialize a resource manager, take handles, create results,
//! process, read values, free in the right order) into ordinary Rust values
//! that free themselves and enforce the correct ordering through ownership.
//!
//! # What it provides
//!
//! - A [`PerformanceProfile`] that selects one of the predefined native
//!   configurations (in memory, high performance, low memory, balanced or the
//!   engine default).
//! - A `Manager` per engine ([`dd::Manager`], [`ipi::Manager`]) that owns a
//!   loaded data set. It is reference counted (returned inside an [`Arc`](std::sync::Arc)) and
//!   is [`Send`] and [`Sync`], because the native resource manager is internally
//!   reference counted and lock protected, so one loaded data set is shared
//!   across threads cheaply.
//! - A `Results` per engine ([`dd::Results`], [`ipi::Results`]) that owns a
//!   native results structure and holds an [`Arc`](std::sync::Arc) to its manager so the data
//!   set cannot be freed while a result still references it. It is [`Send`] but
//!   deliberately not [`Sync`], because a native results structure is per-thread
//!   scratch that the engine mutates in place.
//! - Lazy property name to required-property-index resolution, computed once per
//!   manager and cached, plus value reads into a reusable, growable per-thread
//!   byte buffer so a fast lookup does not allocate per property.
//! - Evidence marshalling from the pipeline `prefix.field` model into the native
//!   representation, reusing a thread-local pooled evidence array and value
//!   buffers (see [`evidence`]).
//! - Mapping of every native non-success status code and set exception onto
//!   [`fiftyone_pipeline_core::Error::Native`], so the safe layer raises one
//!   error type.
//!
//! # Device Detection and IP Intelligence coexist
//!
//! The two engines compile their own copies of the shared `common-cxx` layer.
//! The IP Intelligence build widens the file offset types for large data file
//! support, which makes its `common-cxx` objects ABI incompatible with the
//! Device Detection (and `fiftyone-common-sys`) build. Both copies once exported
//! the same `fiftyoneDegrees*` C symbols, so linking both engines into one
//! binary made the linker bind each duplicated symbol to a single definition and
//! left one engine reading its data through the wrong common code.
//!
//! That collision is resolved at the source. IP Intelligence compiles its
//! private copy of `common-cxx` into an `ipi_` prefixed symbol namespace (see
//! `fiftyone-ip-intelligence-sys`), so the two copies no longer share a symbol
//! and both engines load real data files side by side in one process. The two
//! engines still get separate [`dd`] and [`ipi`] modules with their own
//! `Manager` and `Results`, because the native types and life cycles differ, and
//! they share the safe machinery in this crate (the profile, the status and
//! exception mapping, the value buffer). Concretely, Device Detection builds a
//! native evidence array through the `fiftyone-common-sys` evidence functions,
//! while IP Intelligence is driven from the client IP string, which is the
//! natural entry point for that engine.
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use fiftyone_native::{PerformanceProfile, dd};
//!
//! # fn main() -> fiftyone_pipeline_core::Result<()> {
//! // Load a Hash data file once and share it across threads.
//! let manager = dd::Manager::open("51Degrees-LiteV4.1.hash", PerformanceProfile::Default)?;
//!
//! // One results structure per thread.
//! let mut results = manager.create_results()?;
//! results.process_user_agent(
//!     "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36",
//! )?;
//!
//! if let Some(is_mobile) = results.value_as_string("IsMobile", ",")? {
//!     println!("IsMobile = {is_mobile}");
//! }
//! # Ok(())
//! # }
//! ```

// it is only needed when at least one product feature is on.

mod status;

// Device Detection is gated behind the `dd` feature and IP Intelligence behind
// `ipi`, and both are on by default. Each product links its own copy of
// common-cxx, but IP Intelligence's copy is compiled into an `ipi_` prefixed
// symbol namespace, so the two no longer collide and a binary may enable both
// (see this crate's Cargo.toml). The features remain a slimming knob for a
// consumer that wants only one engine. The product-agnostic items below (the
// performance profile, the status and exception mapping, the evidence helpers)
// compile with either feature or none.
