//! A reusable, growable byte buffer used to read native string values.
//!
//! The native value getters write into a caller supplied buffer and return the
//! number of characters that were available. When that exceeds the buffer size
//! the buffer was too small and the call must be retried with a larger buffer.
//! Allocating a fresh buffer for every property of every request would dominate
//! the cost of a fast on-premise lookup, so this module keeps one buffer per
//! thread and grows it only when a value does not fit.
//!
//! The buffer is keyed by thread and never shared, matching the per-thread,
//! single `FlowData` processing model the pipeline uses, so no locking is
//! needed on the hot path.

/// this is enough to satisfy the common case in a single native call.

/// The largest buffer this helper will grow to. A native getter that keeps
/// reporting a larger required size than this is treated as misbehaving and the
/// read is abandoned rather than allowed to allocate without bound.

/// Read a string value into the thread-local buffer using a native getter.
///
/// `writer` is invoked with a writable pointer and the buffer length in bytes.
/// It must write up to that many bytes and return the number of characters that
/// were available (the convention every native `GetValuesString` function uses).
/// When the returned count exceeds the buffer length the buffer is grown to fit
/// and `writer` is invoked again, repeating until the value fits or the maximum
/// capacity is reached.
///
/// On success the decoded value is handed to `consume`, which borrows it for the
/// duration of the call. The value is not allocated as an owned [`String`], so a
/// caller that only needs to inspect or copy part of it pays no extra
/// allocation. Returns [`None`] when the writer reports a zero length value or
/// when the value will not fit within [`MAX_CAPACITY`].
///
/// # Safety
/// `writer` must only write within the `length` bytes it is given and must
/// return the available character count using the native convention.
