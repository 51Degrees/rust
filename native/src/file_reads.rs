//! Keeps the calls that can read a data file within the handles its pool
//! holds.
//!
//! A data set that reads from its file after it is loaded holds a fixed pool
//! of file handles, one for each concurrent operation it was opened to
//! expect. A read that finds every handle in use does not wait for one. It
//! fails with `InsufficientHandles`, and in the IP Intelligence library a
//! failed read of a property's values ends the process. A permit taken before
//! each such call makes a caller beyond the size of the pool wait instead.
