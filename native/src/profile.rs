//! The performance profile that selects a native engine configuration.
//!
//! Both Device Detection and IP Intelligence ship the same family of predefined
//! native configurations. They trade memory footprint against lookup speed in
//! the same way, so a single profile enum picks the right configuration global
//! for whichever engine is being initialised. The selection itself lives in the
//! engine specific submodules ([`crate::dd`] and [`crate::ipi`]) because each
//! engine links its own copy of the configuration globals.

/// The performance profile applied when a native engine manager is initialised.
///
/// The variants mirror the predefined native configuration globals exported by
/// each engine (`...InMemoryConfig`, `...HighPerformanceConfig`,
/// `...LowMemoryConfig`, `...BalancedConfig` and `...DefaultConfig`).
///
/// [`PerformanceProfile::Default`] is the recommended starting point. It uses a
/// balanced operating mode without creating a temporary copy of the data file.
#[derive(Debug, Clone, Copy, PartialEq, Eq, Hash, Default)]

    /// not held open after initialisation. This is the fastest to query but uses

    /// Load everything into memory and drop the connection to the source file.
    /// The highest sustained query performance.
    HighPerformance,
    /// Keep a connection to the data file and use no caching, for the smallest
