//! Mapping native status codes and exceptions onto the pipeline error model.
//!
//! Every native call either succeeds or reports a failure in one of two ways. A
//! `StatusCode` other than `Success` is returned from an initialisation call, or
//! an `Exception` structure is set by a processing call. Both are surfaced to
//! the safe layer as [`fiftyone_pipeline_core::Error::Native`], carrying the
//! status name and a human readable message taken from the native library where
//! one is available.
//!
//! Device Detection and IP Intelligence compile separate copies of the shared
//! `common-cxx` layer (the IP Intelligence build widens the file offset types,
//! see the `fiftyone-ip-intelligence-sys` crate docs). That gives each engine
//! its own distinct, although structurally identical, `StatusCode` and
//! `Exception` types and its own message functions. The [`NativeStatus`] and
//! [`NativeException`] traits let one set of mapping helpers work against either
//! engine's types, with each engine implementing the trait against its own
//! library functions in [`crate::dd`] and [`crate::ipi`].
