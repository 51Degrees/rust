//! Integration tests for the on-premise IP Intelligence engine, across the data
//! tiers the Rust workspace knows about.
//!
//! The tiers exercise different files and different cost/coverage trade-offs:
//!
//! - **ASN** (`51Degrees-IPIV4AsnIpiV41.ipi`). Small, current and always
//!   loadable, and checked into the data repository, so the ASN tests run by
//!   default and are the primary on-premise coverage.
//! - **Enterprise** (`51Degrees-IPIV4EnterpriseIpiV41.ipi`). Full property
//!   coverage. The Enterprise test is `#[ignore]` because the file is large and
//!   the share is reachable only on the 51Degrees network; run it explicitly with
//!   `--ignored` (or `--include-ignored`) on a machine where the share is mounted.
//!
//! Every tier resolves its data file at run time and skips cleanly when the file
//! is absent, so a checkout without the data files (and an off-network CI) stays
//! green while a developer with the files gets real native coverage. An explicit
//! `51DEGREES_IPI_PATH` overrides the ASN path so a single file can drive the
//! default tests.
