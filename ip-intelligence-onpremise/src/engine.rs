//! The [`IpIntelligenceOnPremiseEngine`] flow element.

//! The engine wraps a native IP Intelligence [`Manager`](fiftyone_native::ipi::Manager)
//! and turns each pipeline request into a native lookup, returning an
//! [`IpIntelligenceDataBase`] that reads each property from the lookup's native
//! results the first time it is requested. See the crate-level documentation
//! for the design rationale.
