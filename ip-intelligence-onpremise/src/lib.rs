//! The on-premise IP-intelligence aspect engine.
//!
//! This crate wraps the safe native IP Intelligence resource manager from
//! [`fiftyone_native::ipi`] in a pipeline `FlowElement` so a `.ipi` data file
//! can be queried as part of a 51Degrees pipeline.
//!
//! # What it produces
//!
//! The engine populates an [`IpIntelligenceDataBase`] (from the shared
//! [`fiftyone_ip_intelligence_shared`] crate) under the shared
//! [`IP_DATA_KEY`], the same element-data type and key the cloud engine
//! populates. A consuming application can therefore swap the on-premise engine
//! for the cloud one (or run both) and read the result the same way, satisfying
//! the engine-compatibility requirement from the workspace coordination notes.
//!
//! Because IP Intelligence values are probabilistic, each property is read
//! through the native *weighted* getter
//! [`fiftyone_native::ipi::Results::values_weighted`], which returns every
//! candidate value paired with its raw `u16` weighting (highest first). The
//! engine parses each candidate into the property's value type (string, double
//! or integer) and stores the resulting `Vec<WeightedValue<T>>` through the
//! matching `set_weighted_*` builder on the data, so the typed accessors on
//! [`IpIntelligenceData`] return the full weighted distribution.
//!
//! # On-premise specifics
//!
//! - **No results cache.** Native results need explicit cleanup and are not
//!   safe to cache, so this engine never attaches a results cache (per the
//!   coordination notes, only the cloud path may cache). It still embeds an
//!   `AspectEngineBase` with no cache so its `process` flow matches the rest of
//!   the engine layer.
//! - **Driven from the client IP.** IP Intelligence is looked up from the client
//!   IP string rather than a native evidence array, using
//!   [`fiftyone_native::evidence::client_ip_from_evidence`]. The accepted
//!   evidence keys are the IP keys ([`fiftyone_pipeline_core::constants::EVIDENCE_CLIENT_IP_KEY`],
//!   the `query`/`server` client-ip variants and the 51Degrees-prefixed forms).
//! - **Refreshable.** The loaded [`fiftyone_native::ipi::Manager`] lives behind
//!   an [`arc_swap::ArcSwap`] so `OnPremiseAspectEngine::refresh` can hot-swap
//!   a freshly reloaded data set while concurrent `process` calls keep using the
//!   old one until the swap completes, as the data-updates specification
//!   requires.
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use std::sync::Arc;
//! use fiftyone_pipeline_core::{Evidence, Pipeline};
//! use fiftyone_pipeline_engines::AspectData;
//! use fiftyone_ip_intelligence_shared::{IpIntelligenceData, IP_DATA_KEY};
//! use fiftyone_ip_intelligence_onpremise::IpIntelligenceOnPremiseEngine;
//! use fiftyone_native::PerformanceProfile;
//!
//! # fn main() -> fiftyone_pipeline_core::Result<()> {
//! let engine = IpIntelligenceOnPremiseEngine::builder("51Degrees-IPIV4AsnIpiV41.ipi")
//!     .performance_profile(PerformanceProfile::HighPerformance)
//!     .build()?;
//!
//! let pipeline = Pipeline::builder().add_element(Arc::new(engine)).build()?;
//! let mut data = pipeline.create_flow_data_with(
//!     Evidence::builder().add("server.client-ip", "185.28.167.77").build(),
//! );
//! data.process()?;
//!
//! if let Some(ip) = data.get(IP_DATA_KEY) {
//!     if let Ok(countries) = ip.registered_country().value() {
//!         if let Some(top) = countries.first() {
//!             println!("registered country = {} (weighting {})", top.value, top.weighting());
//!         }
//!     }
//! }
//! # Ok(())
//! # }
//! ```
