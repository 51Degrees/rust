//!
//! # 51Degrees device-detection shared model
//!
//! The pieces of device detection that the on-premise and cloud engines both
//! build on, implementing the
//! [device-detection specification](https://github.com/51Degrees/specifications/tree/main/device-detection-specification).
//! Keeping these here, rather than in either engine crate, is what makes the two
//! engines interface-compatible: both populate the same [`DeviceDataBase`] under
//! the same [`DEVICE_DATA_KEY`], so a consuming application can swap an
//! on-premise engine for a cloud one (or the reverse) without touching its
//! result-reading code.
//!
//! ## What the crate provides
//!
//! - [`DeviceData`], a trait extending
//!   [`fiftyone_pipeline_engines::AspectData`] with one strongly-typed
//!   [`AspectPropertyValue`](fiftyone_pipeline_engines::AspectPropertyValue)
//!   accessor per documented Device Detection property (hardware, operating
//!   system, browser, crawler and the on-premise match metrics). The trait and
//!   its implementation are generated from the common metadata by the
//!   51Degrees PropertyGenerator tool into an internal `device_data` module.
//! - [`DeviceDataBase`], a concrete backing that embeds an
//!   [`AspectDataBase`](fiftyone_pipeline_engines::AspectDataBase) and reads
//!   each typed property out of the dynamic property bag, wrapping it in an
//!   `AspectPropertyValue`. Both engines write into one of these.
//! - [`DEVICE_DATA_KEY`], the [`TypedKey`](fiftyone_pipeline_core::TypedKey)
//!   used to store and retrieve the device data, with the data key string
//!   `"device"`.
//! - [`GENERATED_PROPERTY_TYPES`] (and the [`declared_property_value_type`] /
//!   [`default_property_metadata`] helpers derived from it) which a wrapper can
//!   use to type and publish the generated property set.
//! - [`UachJsConversionElement`], the User-Agent Client Hints high-entropy
//!   decoder element described in the
//!   [UA-CH high-entropy decoder specification](https://github.com/51Degrees/specifications/blob/main/device-detection-specification/pipeline-elements/uach-high-entropy-decoder.md).
//!
//! ## The dynamic property bag is always available
//!
//! Beyond the generated typed accessors, every property a 51Degrees data file or
//! resource key returns is reachable through the dynamic bag inherited from
//! [`ElementData::get`](fiftyone_pipeline_core::ElementData::get) by its string
//! name (for example `device.get("ScreenMMWidth")`). The typed accessors are a
//! convenience over that bag, not a replacement for it, and they read from
//! exactly the same store.
