//! [![51Degrees](https://51degrees.com/img/logo.png?utm_source=docs.rs&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=rust&utm_content=fiftyone-fodid-cloud-lib.rs&utm_term=logo "Data rewards the curious")](https://51degrees.com/?utm_source=docs.rs&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=rust&utm_content=fiftyone-fodid-cloud-lib.rs&utm_term=logo)
//!
//! Cloud engine that unpacks the 51Degrees identifier (51Did / FODid) block from
//! the cloud JSON response into typed data.
//!
//! # What this crate does
//!
//! A 51Degrees cloud response carries each requested product in its own
//! top-level JSON member: `device` for device detection, `ip` for IP
//! intelligence, and `fodid` for the 51Degrees identifier. This crate provides
//! the pipeline element that owns the `fodid` member.
//!
//! [`FodIdCloudEngine`] sits after a
//! [`CloudRequestEngine`](fiftyone_cloud_request_engine::CloudRequestEngine) in a
//! pipeline. The request engine makes the single HTTP call and stores the raw
//! JSON; this engine slices out the `fodid` member and maps it into a
//! [`FodIdDataBase`], stored under [`FODID_DATA_KEY`].
//!
//! # The identifier values
//!
//! The block holds two probabilistic identifiers, each a base64-encoded
//! [OWID](https://github.com/SWAN-community/owid) envelope:
//!
//! - [`IdProbGlobal`](ID_PROB_GLOBAL_PROPERTY), unique across all callers
//!   observing the same device and network, and
//! - [`IdProbLic`](ID_PROB_LIC_PROPERTY), unique only across the caller's own
//!   license key.
//!
//! Both are exposed in two forms: the raw base64 string
//! ([`FodIdData::id_prob_global`]), and the parsed
//! [`FodId`] ([`FodIdData::id_prob_global_fod_id`]) which unpacks
//! the envelope's payload (flags, license id, the 32-byte hash) and the OWID
//! domain, date and signature. The parsing reuses the [`fodid`] reader, so the
//! envelope handling is identical whether a 51Did arrives from the cloud or is
//! read from a stored cookie.
//!
//! # Cloud only
//!
//! A 51Did is issued by the cloud, which alone holds the signing key, so there
//! is no on-premise engine that produces the same data (unlike device detection
//! and IP intelligence, which have interchangeable cloud and on-premise
//! engines). [`FodIdCloudEngine`] is the only producer of [`FODID_DATA_KEY`].
