//! # Shared example and test helpers
//!
//! The helper library used by every runnable example and example test in the
//! workspace. It gathers the shared example utilities (data-file location,
//! resource-key resolution, sample evidence and property formatting) into one
//! small crate so the examples themselves stay focused on the feature they show.
//!
//! It deliberately keeps a minimal dependency surface, only
//! [`fiftyone_pipeline_core`] and [`fiftyone_pipeline_engines`], so it can be
//! shared by Device Detection, IP Intelligence and pipeline examples alike
//! without pulling in either detection facade.
//!
//! ## What it provides
//!
//! - [`find_file`] / [`find_file_from`]. Walk up the directory tree to locate a
//!   data or resource file, so it resolves whether an example runs from an IDE,
//!   its own crate directory, or a CI checkout.
//! - [`resource_key_from_env`] and [`is_invalid_key`]. Read a cloud resource key
//!   from the aligned, legacy and CI-exported environment variables, and screen
//!   out obvious placeholders.
//! - [`dd_data_path`] and [`ipi_data_path`]. Resolve the on-premise Device
//!   Detection and IP Intelligence data files, the latter through the three-tier
//!   ([`IpiTier`]) Enterprise/Lite/ASN scheme.
//! - [`check_data_file`] and [`data_file_info`]. Inspect an on-premise engine's
//!   data file and return age and Lite-tier warnings for the example to print.
//! - [`get_property_as_string`]. Render any property from an element data bag to
//!   a display string, handling the missing and no-value cases.
//! - A set of sample evidence values (see the [`evidence`] module) covering the
//!   common detection paths.
