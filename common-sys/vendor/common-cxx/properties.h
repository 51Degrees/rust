/**
 * @ingroup FiftyOneDegreesCommon
 * @defgroup FiftyOneDegreesProperties Properties
 *
 * Structures for properties which are available, or required.
 *
 * ## Terms
 *
 * **Required Property Index** : the 0 based index of the property in the list
 * of required properties. Not the same as the property index.
 *
 * **Property Index** : the 0 based index of the property in the source used to 
 * create the required properties. Not the same as the required property index.
 *
 * **Results** : the structure used to contain the data associated with the 
 * available required properties.
 *
 * **Source** : the source of property names. Typically a call back method to
 * return properties from the data structure used by the aspect engine.
 *
 * ## Introduction
 *
 * Aspect engine performance can often be improved by limiting the properties
 * that can be returned from the engine. As this is a performance feature 
 * shared across different types of aspect engine the utility functions are
 * stored in the common C files.
 *
 * Required properties could be specified at initialisation as a character 
 * separated string, as an array of strings or from an existing set of 
 * properties already obtained from these methods. In all scenarios it is 
 * desirable to be able to query the properties and find their indexes in the 
 * source data structure using a consistent set of methods.
 *
 * ## Creation
 *
 * #fiftyoneDegreesPropertiesCreate is used to create a consistent set of 
 * required properties. The structure passed must have one of the follow set.
 *
 * 1. Separated string of property names. Valid separators include space,
 * comma and pipe.
 * 2. An array of strings.
 * 3. Existing properties results from a previous creation operation. This 
 * method is used when a data set is being reloaded due to a change in the 
 * underlying data.
 *
 * Creation also requires a method to retrieve the name of the properties from 
 * the underlying data source. A method pointer conforming to 
 * #fiftyoneDegreesPropertiesGetMethod must be provided to retrieve the
 * property name string item for a given property index up to the maximum
 * count. The call back is used to avoid any hard dependency between the data
 * structure and the properties methods.
 *
 * Unlike standard collection item retrieval the properties methods will not 
 * know the underlying collection implement or reference from which the item 
 * was obtained from. Therefore the implementation of get MUST set the 
 * collection field of the collection item.
 *
 * Some, or all, of the required properties may not be present in the
 * underlying data source. Any missing properties will be ignored in the
 * results. The get  name from required index method can be used to iterate
 * over the available  properties. The number of available properties after
 * creation can be obtained  from the count field of properties results.
 *
 * Whilst the property names can be provided as string(s) the property names 
 * referenced from the properties results are collection items from a strings 
 * collection. The properties methods are responsible for releasing the 
 * references to these strings when the properties results are freed.
 *
 * The resulting require properties index will be in ascending order of the 
 * property name a string. As such the ordered list can be used with a binary 
 * search (divide and conquer) to quickly determine the required property index
 * from the property name.
 *
 * ## Free
 *
 * When the properties results are finished with, the 
 * #fiftyoneDegreesPropertiesFree method must be used. This will also free the 
 * collection items used to reference the property name strings using the 
 * collection field of the item to obtain the source collection. This
 * collection must have been set by the get method used at creation.
 *
 * ## Operation
 *
 * Several methods are available which can be used to convert from an input 
 * such as a property name or required property index to a property index in 
 * the data structure. The method names are self-explanatory.
 *
 * Where possible using integer property or required property indexes is 
 * preferable to the string representation of the property as this improves 
 * performance.
