//!
//! Raw FFI bindings to the `common-cxx` C library shared by the on-premise
//! Device Detection and IP Intelligence engines.
//!
//! This crate is the native foundation that both products build on. It owns the
//! compilation and static linking of the `common-cxx` C sources (as the
//! `fiftyone-common-c` library) and exposes hand written `extern "C"`
//! declarations and `#[repr(C)]` structures for the portion of the public ABI
//! that is genuinely shared between the products.
//!
//! The bound surface is deliberately the common subset only:
//!
//! - **Status** ([`StatusCode`] and [`fiftyoneDegreesStatusGetMessage`]).
//! - **Exception** ([`Exception`], [`fiftyoneDegreesExceptionGetMessage`] and
//!   the okay/clear helpers).
//! - **Resource manager** ([`ResourceManager`] with init, free, handle
//!   increment, decrement and use-count helpers).
//! - **Evidence** ([`EvidenceKeyValuePairArray`], create, free, add and iterate,
//!   plus the [`EvidencePrefix`] enum and prefix mapping).
//! - **Properties** ([`PropertiesRequired`]).
//! - **Memory** ([`fiftyoneDegreesMemoryStandardFree`]) so that strings
//!   allocated by the library can be released through the matching allocator.
//!
//! Internals such as collections, data sets and headers are exposed as opaque
//! pointer types. Only the structures that actually cross the boundary in this
//! shared surface are given a concrete `#[repr(C)]` layout. Engine specific
//! surfaces (the Hash device detection results and the IP Intelligence results)
//! live in the `device-detection-sys` and `ip-intelligence-sys` crates which
//! link this one.
//!
//! # Safety
//!
//! Every item in this crate is an unchecked binding to a C function or
//! structure. Callers are responsible for upholding the contracts described in
//! the upstream headers (`exceptions.h`, `status.h`, `resource.h`,
//! `evidence.h`, `properties.h` and `memory.h`). The names mirror the C names
//! exactly so the headers remain the authoritative reference.
