//! Build script for `fiftyone-device-detection-sys`.
//!
//! This compiles the Hash on-premise C layer from the 51degrees-cxx sources
//! directly with the `cc` crate and links it statically as
//! `fiftyone-device-detection-c`. The shared common C layer is supplied by
//! the `fiftyone-common-sys` crate (linked as `fiftyone-common-c`), so only the
//! device detection and Hash sources are compiled here.
//!
//! The two library source groups are the device detection C sources in
//! `src/dd` (the `fiftyone-device-detection-c` CMake target) and the Hash C
//! sources in `src/dd/hash` (the `fiftyone-hash-c` CMake target). Both are
//! placed in a single static archive here because Cargo links one native
//! library per `links` key.
//!
//! A small C shim (`src/shim.c` in this crate) is compiled alongside them. It
//! exposes a handful of property enumeration helpers that read fields buried
//! inside the deeply nested data set structures, which keeps the Rust side free
//! of any need to mirror those private C layouts.
//!
//! The sources are found as `resolve_cxx_dir` describes. When a Lite Hash data
//! file is found beside them, its path is exported as the `51DEGREES_DD_PATH`
//! compile time environment variable so the crate's smoke test can run a real
//! detection.
