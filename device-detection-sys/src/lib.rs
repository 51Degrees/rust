//! [![51Degrees](https://51degrees.com/img/logo.png?utm_source=github&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=rust&utm_content=fiftyone-device-detection-sys-lib.rs&utm_term=logo "Data rewards the curious")](https://51degrees.com/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=rust&utm_content=fiftyone-device-detection-sys-lib.rs&utm_term=logo)
//!
//! Raw FFI bindings to the Hash on-premise device detection ABI in
//! `device-detection-cxx`.
//!
//! This crate is the native foundation for on-premise Hash device detection. It
//! compiles the device detection and Hash C layers from `device-detection-cxx`
//! and links them statically, building on top of the shared `common-cxx` layer
//! supplied by the [`fiftyone_common_sys`] crate. It then exposes hand written
//! `extern "C"` declarations and `#[repr(C)]` structures for the public Hash
//! ABI declared in `src/hash/hash.h`.
//!
//! The bound surface covers the full life cycle of a Hash detection:
//!
//! - **Configuration** ([`ConfigHash`] and the predefined configuration globals
//!   [`fiftyoneDegreesHashDefaultConfig`], [`fiftyoneDegreesHashInMemoryConfig`],
//!   [`fiftyoneDegreesHashHighPerformanceConfig`],
//!   [`fiftyoneDegreesHashLowMemoryConfig`],
//!   [`fiftyoneDegreesHashBalancedConfig`] and
//!   [`fiftyoneDegreesHashBalancedTempConfig`]).
//! - **Manager initialization** ([`fiftyoneDegreesHashInitManagerFromFile`] and
//!   [`fiftyoneDegreesHashInitManagerFromMemory`], plus the matching size
//!   helpers).
//! - **Results** ([`fiftyoneDegreesResultsHashCreate`], the three process
//!   methods [`fiftyoneDegreesResultsHashFromEvidence`],
//!   [`fiftyoneDegreesResultsHashFromUserAgent`] and
//!   [`fiftyoneDegreesResultsHashFromDeviceId`], the value getters
//!   [`fiftyoneDegreesResultsHashGetValuesString`],
//!   [`fiftyoneDegreesResultsHashGetHasValues`],
//!   [`fiftyoneDegreesResultsHashGetNoValueReason`] and
//!   [`fiftyoneDegreesResultsHashFree`]).
//! - **Data set access** ([`fiftyoneDegreesDataSetHashGet`],
//!   [`fiftyoneDegreesDataSetHashRelease`] and
//!   [`fiftyoneDegreesResourceManagerFree`], re-exported from the common crate).
//! - **Metadata enumeration** through the small property and evidence key
//!   helpers ([`fiftyoneDegreesShimHashGetRequiredPropertyCount`] and friends)
//!   compiled from the crate's C shim. These read fields buried in the nested
//!   data set structures so the Rust side need not mirror those private layouts.
//!
//! The deeply nested data set and results structures are exposed as opaque
//! pointer types. Only [`ConfigHash`] and its base structures, which a caller
//! constructs to drive initialization, are given a concrete `#[repr(C)]`
//! layout. The configuration globals are used unmodified in the common case, so
//! most callers never need to touch the configuration layout at all.
//!
//! Shared types ([`ResourceManager`], [`Exception`], [`StatusCode`],
//! [`PropertiesRequired`], the evidence types and the standard free function)
//! are re-exported from [`fiftyone_common_sys`] so a caller has a single import
//! surface for a full detection.
//!
//! # Safety
//!
//! Every item in this crate is an unchecked binding to a C function or
//! structure. Callers must uphold the contracts described in `hash.h` and the
//! shared `common-cxx` headers. The names mirror the C names exactly so the
//! headers remain the authoritative reference. In particular a results
//! structure must be freed with [`fiftyoneDegreesResultsHashFree`] before its
//! manager is freed with [`fiftyoneDegreesResourceManagerFree`], and a data set
//! reference taken with [`fiftyoneDegreesDataSetHashGet`] must be released with
//! [`fiftyoneDegreesDataSetHashRelease`].
