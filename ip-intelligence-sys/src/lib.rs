//!
//! Raw FFI bindings to the on-premise IP Intelligence ABI (`Ipi`) in
//! `ip-intelligence-cxx`, including the weighted value getters.
//!
//! This crate owns the compilation and static linking of the
//! `fiftyone-ip-intelligence-c` native library (see `build.rs`) and exposes
//! hand written `extern "C"` declarations and `#[repr(C)]` structures for the
//! public `Ipi` C ABI declared in `ipi.h` and `ipi_weighted_results.h`.
//!
//! The shared common types (the [`Exception`], [`StatusCode`],
//! [`ResourceManager`], [`PropertiesRequired`] and evidence structures) live in
//! the [`common`] submodule. They are declared locally rather than reused from
//! `fiftyone-common-sys` because the IP Intelligence engine is compiled with 64
//! bit file offsets and must link its own `common-cxx` (see the [`common`]
//! module docs). Only the IP Intelligence specific surface is declared on top:
//!
//! - **Initialization** ([`fiftyoneDegreesIpiInitManagerFromFile`],
//!   [`fiftyoneDegreesIpiInitManagerFromMemory`] and the size helpers) with the
//!   predefined [`ConfigIpi`] globals
//!   ([`fiftyoneDegreesIpiDefaultConfig`] and the in memory, high performance,
//!   low memory and balanced variants).
//! - **Results** ([`fiftyoneDegreesResultsIpiCreate`],
//!   [`fiftyoneDegreesResultsIpiFromIpAddress`],
//!   [`fiftyoneDegreesResultsIpiFromIpAddressString`],
//!   [`fiftyoneDegreesResultsIpiFromEvidence`] and
//!   [`fiftyoneDegreesResultsIpiFree`]).
//! - **Value access** ([`fiftyoneDegreesResultsIpiGetValuesString`],
//!   [`fiftyoneDegreesResultsIpiGetHasValues`],
//!   [`fiftyoneDegreesResultsIpiGetNoValueReason`] and the legacy weighted
//!   getter [`fiftyoneDegreesResultsIpiGetValues`] returning a
//!   [`ProfilePercentage`]).
//! - **Weighted values** ([`fiftyoneDegreesResultsIpiGetValuesCollection`]
//!   producing a [`WeightedValuesCollection`] of [`WeightedValueHeader`]
//!   pointers, each carrying a `rawWeighting`, and
//!   [`fiftyoneDegreesWeightedValuesCollectionRelease`]).
//! - **Data set and metadata** ([`fiftyoneDegreesDataSetIpiGet`],
//!   [`fiftyoneDegreesDataSetIpiRelease`] and
//!   [`fiftyoneDegreesResourceManagerFree`], which is declared against this
//!   crate's own `common-cxx` build).
//! - **Property enumeration shim**
//!   ([`fiftyoneDegreesShimIpiGetRequiredPropertyCount`],
//!   [`fiftyoneDegreesShimIpiGetRequiredPropertyName`] and
//!   [`fiftyoneDegreesShimIpiGetRequiredPropertyIndexFromName`]). These flat
//!   helpers are compiled from this crate's own `src/shim.c` (not the upstream
//!   library) and read the `available` property set buried deep inside the data
//!   set structures, so the Rust side does not mirror those private C layouts.
//!   They mirror the equivalent shim in `fiftyone-device-detection-sys`.
//!
//! Internals such as collections, data sets, graphs and headers are exposed as
//! opaque pointer types. Only the structures that genuinely cross the boundary
//! in this surface are given a concrete `#[repr(C)]` layout. The names mirror
//! the C names exactly so the headers remain the authoritative reference.
//!
//! # Safety
//!
//! Every item in this crate is an unchecked binding to a C function or
//! structure. Callers are responsible for upholding the contracts described in
//! the upstream headers (`ipi.h`, `ipi_weighted_results.h` and the shared
//! `common-cxx` headers). Pointers handed to these functions must be valid, and
//! results and weighted value collections must be freed with their matching
//! release functions.
