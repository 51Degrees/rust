/*
 * Property and header enumeration shim for fiftyone-ip-intelligence-sys.
 *
 * The set of properties an IP Intelligence data set was initialized with, and
 * the headers it reads the client IP from, live in the `available` and
 * `uniqueHeaders` members of the base data set, several layers of nested
 * structures deep (DataSetIpi -> DataSetIpiBase b -> DataSetBase b). Reaching
 * them from Rust would require mirroring every intermediate C struct exactly,
 * which is fragile across platforms and compiler versions. The helpers below
 * read those private layouts from C, where the headers describe them, and
 * present a flat C ABI to the Rust crate. They use only the public IP
 * Intelligence and common C library headers, so they stay correct as the upstream
 * layouts change.
 *
 * This mirrors the equivalent shim in fiftyone-device-detection-sys. The Hash
 * data set nests as DataSetHash -> DataSetHashBase b -> DataSetBase b, so the
 * `dataSet->b.b` access path is the same in both engines.
