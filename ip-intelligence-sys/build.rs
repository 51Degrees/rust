//! Build script for `fiftyone-ip-intelligence-sys`.
//!
//! This compiles the on-premise IP Intelligence C library directly with the
//! `cc` crate and links it statically as `fiftyone-ip-intelligence-c`. The
//! library is built self contained, meaning the shared common C sources in
//! `src/common` and the graph sources in `src/ipi/graph` are compiled in
//! alongside the `ipi.c` and `ipi_weighted_results.c` engine sources in
//! `src/ipi`. Every C source is compiled into one static library.
//!
//! The library is deliberately self contained rather than reusing the
//! `fiftyone-common-c` native library owned by `fiftyone-common-sys`. The IP
//! Intelligence data format uses 64 bit file offsets, so the whole library
//! (including the shared common sources it calls) must be compiled with
//! `FIFTYONE_DEGREES_LARGE_DATA_FILE_SUPPORT`, which widens
//! `fiftyoneDegreesFileOffset` and the on disk offset types to 64 bit. The
//! common library compiled by `fiftyone-common-sys` does not set that define,
//! so its objects use 32 bit offsets and are ABI incompatible with the IP
//! Intelligence engine. Compiling a private copy of the common sources here
//! with the correct define is the only sound option.
//!
//! The `cc` crate locates the MSVC toolchain through `vswhere` on Windows, so
//! `cl.exe` does not need to be on `PATH`. On other platforms it uses the
//! system C compiler in the usual way.
//!
//! The sources are found as `resolve_cxx_dir` describes.
