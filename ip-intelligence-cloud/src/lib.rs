//! Cloud IP-intelligence engine that maps the cloud JSON response to
//! [`IpIntelligenceDataBase`].
//!
//! This crate realises the
//! [ip-intelligence-cloud specification](https://github.com/51Degrees/specifications/blob/main/ip-intelligence-specification/pipeline-elements/ip-intelligence-cloud.md).
//!
//! # Where it sits
//!
//! A cloud IP-intelligence pipeline has a
//! [`fiftyone_cloud_request_engine::CloudRequestEngine`] followed by an
//! [`IpIntelligenceCloudEngine`]. The request engine makes the single HTTP call
//! and stores the raw JSON response under its `cloud` data key. This engine then
//! reads that JSON, slices out the part it owns (the `ip` member) and
//! deserializes it into the shared
//! [`IpIntelligenceDataBase`], stored under [`IP_DATA_KEY`]. Because both the
//! cloud and on-premise engines produce that same type under that same key, a
//! consuming application can swap one engine for the other without changing how
//! it reads results.
//!
//! # Weighted values
//!
//! IP Intelligence properties are probabilistic, so the cloud encodes each one
//! as a JSON array of `{ "rawweighting": <u16>, "value": <candidate> }` objects.
//! This engine parses every array into a `Vec<`[`WeightedValue`]`<T>>` and
//! inserts it through the shared `set_weighted_*` methods, which sort the list
//! high weighting first and write the dynamic-bag mirror. The candidate type is
//! chosen from the cloud property metadata `Type` field (for example
//! `WeightedString`, `WeightedInteger`, `WeightedDouble`) when it is available,
//! and otherwise inferred from the JSON value itself.
//!
//! # No values
//!
//! When the cloud determines nothing for a property it sends `null` (or omits
//! it) and supplies a reason. Two reason encodings are handled, matching the two
//! shapes the cloud service has used:
//!
//! - a sibling `<propertyname>nullreason` entry next to the property, and
//! - a single top-level `nullValueReasons` object keyed by property name.
//!
//! Either way the reason is recorded through the shared `set_*_no_value`
//! methods, so the typed accessor returns an [`AspectPropertyValue::NoValue`]
//! carrying the message.
