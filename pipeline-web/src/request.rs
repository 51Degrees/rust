//! Framework-neutral request access and evidence population.
//!
//! This module is the framework-neutral web request evidence service. It
//! defines [`RequestData`], a trait an adapter implements over its framework's
//! request type, and [`build_evidence`], a function that turns one request into
//! a [`fiftyone_pipeline_core::Evidence`] honouring the pipeline's evidence-key
//! filter.
//!
//! Keeping the trait abstract is the whole point: nothing here knows about
//! axum, hyper, actix or any other framework. Each adapter supplies the small
//! shim that reads headers, cookies, query and form parameters from a real
//! request, and this crate maps them onto the prefixed evidence keys the
//! pipeline expects.
//!
//! # The mapping
//!
//! Each piece of request data becomes a prefixed evidence key, following the
//! [evidence specification](https://github.com/51Degrees/specifications/blob/main/pipeline-specification/features/evidence.md):
//!
//! - every header `name: value` becomes `header.<name>`,
//! - every cookie `name=value` becomes `cookie.<name>`,
//! - every query-string parameter `name=value` becomes `query.<name>`,
//! - every form (POST body) parameter becomes `query.<name>` as well, folding
//!   form fields into the query prefix so the client-side callback (a form POST)
//!   lands under the same keys as a GET,
//! - the client IP address becomes `server.client-ip`,
//! - the request protocol (`http` or `https`) becomes `header.protocol`.
//!
//! Every candidate key is added **only if the supplied filter includes it**, so
//! a pipeline never receives evidence no element can use. This keeps the cache
//! key and the web `Vary` header tight.

/// is free about how it stores the underlying request; the cost of a little

/// Build a [`fiftyone_pipeline_core::Evidence`] from a request, including only

/// This is the framework-neutral core of the web request evidence service.
/// The `filter` is normally the pipeline-wide filter
/// ([`fiftyone_pipeline_core::Pipeline::evidence_key_filter`]), so the resulting
/// evidence contains exactly the keys some element in the pipeline can use and
/// nothing more.
///
/// # Ordering and conflicts
///
/// Sources are added in the order headers, cookies, query parameters, form
/// parameters, then the client IP and protocol. Because form parameters share
/// the `query.` prefix with query-string parameters, a form field overwrites a
/// query field of the same name (last-writer-wins). The [`Evidence`] itself
/// lowercases keys, so matching downstream
/// is case-insensitive regardless of how the request presented them.
///
