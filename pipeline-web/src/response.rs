//! The framework-neutral HTTP response value.
//!
//! [`WebResponse`] is a plain data structure describing what the client-side
//! endpoints want sent back: a status code, a set of headers and a body. It
//! carries no dependency on any web framework, so an adapter crate (for example
//! the axum adapter) maps it onto that framework's own response type.
//!
//! The body is held as a `Vec<u8>` because the JavaScript and JSON endpoints
//! both produce text that is sent verbatim, and bytes are the lowest common
//! denominator every framework can accept. Convenience constructors
//! ([`WebResponse::text`], [`WebResponse::not_modified`]) cover the two shapes
//! the endpoints return.

/// A framework-neutral HTTP response.
///
/// An adapter turns this into its framework's response. The header list
/// preserves insertion order and may contain repeated names, although the
/// endpoints in this crate never emit a duplicate name.
