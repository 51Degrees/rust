//! Assembling a web-ready pipeline.
//!
//! [`WebPipeline`] is the framework-neutral web pipeline helper. Given the
//! application's own elements (device detection, IP intelligence, a cloud
//! request engine, and so on) and a set of
//! [`WebIntegrationOptions`], it inserts the elements the client-side endpoints
//! need and orders them as the
//! [web-integration specification](https://github.com/51Degrees/specifications/blob/main/pipeline-specification/features/web-integration.md)
//! requires.
//!
//! # Element ordering
//!
//! The built pipeline runs:
//!
//! 1. [`fiftyone_pipeline_engines_fiftyone::SequenceElement`] first, so the
//!    session id and sequence number exist before anything else reads them.
//!    It is only added when the application's elements do not already hold
//!    one, so the elements of a pipeline builder with usage sharing on keep
//!    their own.
//! 2. the application's own elements, in the order they were added.
//! 3. [`fiftyone_pipeline_engines_fiftyone::SetHeadersElement`] (only when
//!    [`WebIntegrationOptions::use_set_header_properties`] is set), after the
//!    core elements so it can see every `SetHeader*` property they produced.
//! 4. [`fiftyone_json_builder::JsonBuilderElement`] as the penultimate element,
//!    so it serializes the results of everything before it.
//! 5. [`fiftyone_javascript_builder::JavaScriptBuilderElement`] last, because it
//!    wraps the JSON the JSON builder produced.
//!
//! When [`WebIntegrationOptions::client_side_evidence_enabled`] is `false` the
//! JSON and JavaScript builders are omitted, because the client-side endpoints
//! are not in use.
//!
//! # Endpoint matching
//!
//! [`WebPipeline::endpoint_for`] and [`endpoint_matches`] decide which endpoint
//! (if any) a request path targets. Matching is a case-insensitive `ends_with`
//! against the configured paths, so an application mounted under a sub-path
//! (for example `/app/51Degrees.core.js`) still routes correctly.
