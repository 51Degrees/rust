//! The client-side endpoint logic.
//!
//! This is the framework-neutral client-side property service. It turns a
//! processed [`fiftyone_pipeline_core::FlowData`] into a
//! [`crate::WebResponse`] for the two client-side endpoints:
//!
//! - [`serve_javascript`] renders the JavaScript include produced by the
//!   JavaScript builder element, served by default at
//!   [`fiftyone_pipeline_core::constants::DEFAULT_CORE_JS_ENDPOINT`].
//! - [`serve_json`] renders the JSON produced by the JSON builder element,
//!   served by default at
//!   [`fiftyone_pipeline_core::constants::DEFAULT_JSON_ENDPOINT`].
//!
//! Both functions apply the same caching and CORS rules, described on each
//! function and realised by the shared helpers below.
//!
//! # The exact response contract
//!
//! For a non-conditional request both endpoints return `200 OK` with:
//!
//! - `Content-Type`: `application/x-javascript` (JS) or `application/json`
//!   (JSON).
//! - `Content-Length`: the UTF-8 byte length of the body.
//! - `Cache-Control`: `private, max-age=1800` when the flow data recorded no
//!   processing errors and the builder's data was there, otherwise
//!   `private, no-cache`. That response carries no `ETag`, so a browser that
//!   kept it fetches it again in full rather than having it confirmed by a
//!   `304`.
//! - `Vary`: the comma-joined list of HTTP-header evidence keys in the
//!   evidence-key whitelist [`EndpointOptions::current_vary_whitelist`] gives,
//!   with the `header.` prefix stripped and the names de-duplicated
//!   case-insensitively. Omitted when the list is empty or there is none.
//! - `ETag`: a weak entity tag, `W/"<16 hex digits>"`, holding a digest of
//!   the cache key the evidence the request supplied produces under the
//!   pipeline filter, before any element adds a value, the same in every
//!   process running the same build. The digest is opaque and non-portable
//!   (see [`compute_etag`]). The tag is weak because
//!   it stands for the evidence, and the content for the same evidence changes
//!   when a data file is refreshed
//!   ([RFC 9110 section 8.8.3](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110#section-8.8.3)).
//! - `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`: the request `Origin` header echoed back,
//!   but only when an origin is present and is not the literal string `null`.
//!
//! When the request's `If-None-Match` field is exactly `*`, or is a list of
//! entity tags one of which matches the computed `ETag` under the weak
//! comparison
//! ([RFC 9110 section 8.8.3.2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110#section-8.8.3.2)),
//! meaning the quoted parts are equal with or without `W/` on either, both
//! endpoints instead return `304 Not Modified` with an empty body and the
//! `Cache-Control`, `Vary`, `ETag` and `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` fields
//! the `200` would have carried, as
//! [RFC 9110 section 15.4.5](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110#section-15.4.5)
//! requires for the first three. So while processing is failing the `304`
//! carries `private, no-cache` and no `ETag`. Whether a builder left no data
//! is read without building the body, so nothing below is logged or built for
//! a `304`. A field that is neither, such as one with `*` among tags or a
//! member that is not an entity tag, gets the `200`, as
//! [RFC 9110 section 13.1.2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110#section-13.1.2)
//! says. The field is every `If-None-Match` line of the request, joined with
//! commas (see [`crate::RequestData::if_none_match`]).
//!
//! A `304` answers `GET` or `HEAD` only. On any other method, such as the
//! `POST` the axum adapter serves the JSON endpoint on, a matching
//! `If-None-Match` gets `412 Precondition Failed` with an empty body, as
//! [RFC 9110 section 13.1.2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110#section-13.1.2)
//! requires, because a response to `POST` is never a `304`
//! ([section 9.3.3](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110#section-9.3.3)).
//! It carries only the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` field, so a script on
//! another origin can read the status. The method is
//! [`crate::RequestData::method`], and a request that does not give one is
//! treated as `GET`. Nothing is logged or built for a `412` either.
//!
//! # When a builder left no data
//!
//! A builder in the pipeline can leave no data for a request, for example when
//! it failed and the pipeline suppresses errors. The endpoint then logs that
//! at error level on each such request, serves the response with
//! `private, no-cache`, and builds the body again from the flow data with the
//! builder the pipeline holds as a resource (see
//! [`fiftyone_pipeline_core::Pipeline::resource`]), used only when it is the
//! same `Arc` as the builder element, as [`crate::WebPipeline`] holds the
//! builders it runs. The JavaScript is built around the JSON builder's
//! output, itself built again if that builder left no data too. When only the
//! JSON builder left no data, the JavaScript builder's script holds
//! placeholder JSON, so it is treated as left out and built again too. With
//! no such resource the body is empty, and a JSON builder that left no data
//! is still logged after the JavaScript builder. A pipeline without the
//! builder serves an empty body and logs nothing. The builder is the element
//! whose data key is the builder's, compared ignoring case, as
//! [`crate::WebPipeline`] compares it when it decides which builders to add.
//!
//! # Where the `Vary` whitelist comes from
//!
//! The [`crate::WebPipeline`] builder collects the header keys every element
//! names through its evidence key filter, and the adapter serves the endpoints
//! with [`crate::WebPipeline::endpoint_options`], which takes that list at each
//! response. An element can still be learning its accepted evidence after the
//! pipeline is built, as the cloud request engine is after a transient
//! discovery failure, so the list is collected again once every element's
//! filter is complete (see [`crate::WebPipeline::vary_whitelist`]). An adapter
//! with its own view of the headers that change the result can pass a
//! different list to [`EndpointOptions::new`].
