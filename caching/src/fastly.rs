//! Stores over Fastly Compute's KV store and core cache, for
//! `wasm32-wasip1`, turned on by the `fastly` feature.
//!
//! [`KvStore`] is global and durable, so it suits the cache of record.
//! [`CoreCache`] is the cache of the point of presence serving the request.
//! It makes concurrent callers there wait for one load, so it suits a layer
//! between process memory and the KV store. Each is a
//! [`ByteStore`](crate::ByteStore), made the store of a
//! [`LoadingCache`](crate::LoadingCache) by
//! [`EncodedStore`](crate::EncodedStore).
//!
//! ```ignore
//! use std::time::Duration;
//! use fiftyone_caching::{fastly, EncodedStore, LoadingCache, Utf8};
