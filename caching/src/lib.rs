//!
//! # 51Degrees caching
//!
//! The caches of the 51Degrees pipeline and of services built with it, as in
//! the caching packages of the other languages.
//!
//! - A sharded least-recently-used cache. It implements the custom cache
//!   described in the
//!   [caching specification](https://github.com/51Degrees/specifications/blob/main/pipeline-specification/features/caching.md)
//!   and exists chiefly to speed up the cloud request engine when many
//!   requests share the same evidence.
//! - A [loading cache](#loading-cache) that loads a missing value once,
//!   however many callers ask for it at the same time, over a store in
//!   memory or a platform's key-value store.
//!
//! ## Why sharded
//!
//! A general-purpose cache was found too slow on the pipeline's hot path. This
//! cache is kept simple and predictable instead. The entries are split across a
//! fixed number of shards, each a [`std::sync::Mutex`] around an
//! insertion-ordered map, so concurrent requests contend on a lock only when
//! they hash to the same shard. Memory use is bounded because each shard evicts
//! its least-recently-used entry once full.
//!
//! ## The pieces
//!
//! - [`Cache`] and [`PutCache`] are the small read and write trait surfaces, so
//!   an engine can depend on the abstraction rather than the concrete cache.
//! - [`LruCache`] is the default sharded LRU implementation. It is generic over
//!   a key `K` and a value `V`, both `Send + Sync`, with `V: Clone`. It is
//!   never generic over `dyn ElementData` because element data is not `Sync`.
//!   Engines cache their own concrete `Send + Sync + Clone` data, typically an
//!   [`std::sync::Arc`] around an aspect-data struct, or the cloud JSON.
//! - [`CacheBuilder`] applies the two tunables from the specification: the
//!   total `size` (default 1000) and the `concurrency`, the number of shards
//!   (default the CPU count).
#![cfg_attr(
    feature = "pipeline",
    doc = "- [`DataKeyedCache`] wraps an [`LruCache`] keyed by
  [`fiftyone_pipeline_core::DataKey`]. An engine hands it a flow data and an
  [`fiftyone_pipeline_core::EvidenceKeyFilter`]; it derives a deterministic,
  case-insensitive key from the relevant evidence, so equivalent requests
  share an entry. It comes with the `pipeline` feature, on by default."
)]
#![cfg_attr(
    not(feature = "pipeline"),
    doc = "- `DataKeyedCache` keys an [`LruCache`] by a flow data's evidence. It
  comes with the `pipeline` feature, which this build leaves out."
)]
//!
//! ## Loading cache
//!
//! [`LoadingCache`] loads a missing value once, however many callers ask for
//! it at the same time. The first caller for a key runs the load, every caller
//! that arrives while it runs waits for the same result, and all of them
//! continue when it completes. A failed load reaches every waiting caller and
//! is not stored, so the next caller loads again. It needs no async runtime
//! and starts no threads of its own.
//!
//! - [`LoadingCache`] does all the work. It is generic over a [`Store`] and a
//!   [`ValueLoader`]. [`LruLoadingCache`] is the form over [`LruStore`], the
//!   least recently used cache in process memory, as `LruLoadingCache` in the
//!   .NET and Java pipelines.
//! - A [`Store`] keeps entries. [`LruStore`] keeps them in process memory. A
//!   store over a platform's key-value store or cache is written against the
//!   same trait.
//! - A [`ValueLoader`] produces a value the store does not hold. The source is
//!   a loader, [`from_fn`] makes one from a function, and every
//!   [`LoadingCache`] is one.
//! - A [`Clock`] gives the time. The system clock is the default, except on
//!   `wasm32-unknown-unknown`, which has none, so a host there supplies one.
//!
//! ### Layers
//!
//! Caches stack by using one as the loader of another. A brief copy in
//! process memory, over a shared key-value store, over the source:
//!
//! ```text
//! LoadingCache(LruStore, time to live 5 s)
//!   loads from LoadingCache(key-value store, time to live 1 day, idle 1 hour)
//!     loads from the source
//! ```
//!
//! A read looks in memory first. On a miss it asks the cache below, which
//! looks in the key-value store, and only a miss there reaches the source.
//! Each cache collapses its own concurrent misses, so many callers missing
//! in memory make one call to the cache below, and many processes missing
//! in a store that can make callers wait make one call to the source. A
//! value changed or removed in the shared store is seen once the memory
//! copy's short life ends.
//!
//! A value carries the time it was written and the time it stops being
//! usable, and a cache never keeps a copy longer than the copy it loaded
//! from, so no copy in a stack outlives the copy below it.
//!
//! ### Loads that outlive their caller
//!
//! By default the first caller for a key does the load, and if it is dropped
//! a waiting caller starts the load again. A host that can run work on its
//! own can give the cache a spawner instead, a [`Spawn`] for any thread or a
//! [`SpawnLocal`] for the current one. The cache then runs each load as a
//! task of its own and every caller, the first included, waits for its
//! result, so a dropped caller neither stops a load nor starts another, as
//! a .NET `Lazy<Task>` does. A hit is still served by the caller, with no
//! task. With a spawner the cache's types must be `'static`, and `Send` and
//! `Sync` too for a spawner on any thread.
//!
//! ### What a store does and what the cache does
//!
//! A store keeps each entry for the time the cache tells it when writing,
//! and may drop entries sooner to make room. A store may also make callers
//! in other processes wait for one load, by answering
//! [`Lookup::Reserved`].
//!
//! The cache does the rest.
//!
//! - It allows one load per key at a time in its process.
//! - It decides each copy's lifetime from its time to live, its time to
//!   idle and the copy it was loaded from.
//! - It renews a used copy at most once per renewal window, so a copy left
//!   unused for the idle time leaves the store.
//! - It checks every entry it reads is still fresh, so a store that drops
//!   entries late, or never, still gives correct results.
//!
//! ### Example
//!
//! ```
//! use std::time::Duration;
//! use fiftyone_caching::{Loaded, LoadingCache, LruLoadingCache, LruStore, ValueLoader};
//!
//! /// Fetches a page from the origin.
//! struct Origin;
//!
//! impl ValueLoader<String, String> for Origin {
//!     type Error = String;
//!
//!     async fn load(&self, url: &String) -> Result<Loaded<String>, String> {
//!         Ok(Loaded::new(format!("page at {url}")))
//!     }
//! }
//!
//! /// The shared copies. A store in memory stands in for a platform store.
//! type Shared = LruLoadingCache<String, String, Origin>;
//!
//! /// A brief copy in memory over the shared copies.
//! type Pages = LruLoadingCache<String, String, Shared>;
//!
//! fn pages() -> Pages {
//!     let shared = LoadingCache::builder(LruStore::builder().build(), Origin)
//!         .time_to_live(Duration::from_secs(24 * 60 * 60))
//!         .time_to_idle(Duration::from_secs(60 * 60))
//!         .build();
//!     LoadingCache::builder(LruStore::builder().size(100).build(), shared)
//!         .time_to_live(Duration::from_secs(5))
//!         .build()
//! }
//!
//! async fn page(pages: &Pages, url: &String) -> Result<String, String> {
//!     pages.get(url).await
//! }
//! # let _ = (pages(), page);
//! ```
//!
//! ## WebAssembly
//!
//! The crate builds for `wasm32-wasip1`, and for `wasm32-unknown-unknown` with
//! default features off. The `pipeline` feature is the only part that needs
//! `fiftyone-pipeline-core`. On WebAssembly `ahash` is seeded when the crate is
//! compiled rather than at run time, because `wasm32-unknown-unknown` has no
//! source of randomness.
//!
//! ## A minimal cache
//!
//! ```
//! use fiftyone_caching::{Cache, LruCache, PutCache};
//!
//! let cache: LruCache<String, u32> = LruCache::with_defaults();
//! cache.put("query.user-agent=abc".to_owned(), 42);
//! assert_eq!(cache.get(&"query.user-agent=abc".to_owned()), Some(42));
//! assert_eq!(cache.get(&"missing".to_owned()), None);
//! ```
