//! One load per key at a time.
//!
//! The first caller for a key becomes the leader. It owns the key's slot
//! until the work ends, either doing the work itself or handing its hold to
//! a task that does. Callers that arrive meanwhile wait on the slot and are
//! woken with the result. If the hold is dropped before a result is
//! published, the waiters are woken to try again, and one of them becomes
//! the new leader.
//!
//! A slot leaves the map before it is given a result, so no caller ever
//! joins a finished slot. A caller that comes later, a woken waiter asking
//! again among them, starts new work rather than receiving an old result.
