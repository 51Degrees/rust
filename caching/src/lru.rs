//! The default sharded LRU cache.
//!
//! This implements the custom sharded LRU cache described in the
//! [caching specification](https://github.com/51Degrees/specifications/blob/main/pipeline-specification/features/caching.md#cache-implementation).
//! Third-party general-purpose caches were found to be too slow for the
//! pipeline's hot path, so this keeps the design simple. A request only touches
//! one shard, so threads contend on a lock only when they hash to the same
//! shard.
//!
//! Each shard is a [`std::sync::Mutex`] around an insertion-ordered map. On a
//! hit the entry is moved to the back (most-recently-used). When a shard is
//! full an insert pops the entry at the front (least-recently-used).

/// A sharded, least-recently-used cache.
///
/// `LruCache` is generic over a key `K` and a value `V`. Both must be `Send +
/// Sync` so the cache itself is `Send + Sync` and can live behind an
/// [`std::sync::Arc`] shared across worker threads. `V` must be `Clone` because
/// [`Cache::get`] returns the value by clone rather than by reference (a borrow
/// cannot outlive the per-shard lock).
///
/// This is the reason the cache is generic over a value type and never over
/// `dyn ElementData`: element data is not `Sync`. Engines instead cache their
/// own concrete `Send + Sync + Clone` data, typically an [`std::sync::Arc`]
/// around an aspect-data struct, or the raw cloud JSON.
///
/// Build one with [`CacheBuilder`] (via [`LruCache::builder`]) or use
/// [`LruCache::with_defaults`] for the specification defaults (size 1000, one
/// shard per CPU).

/// cache.put("a".to_owned(), 1);
/// cache.put("b".to_owned(), 2);
/// assert_eq!(cache.get(&"a".to_owned()), Some(1));
///
/// // The cache holds two entries, so adding a third evicts the least recently
/// // used. "a" was just read so "b" is now the eviction candidate.
/// cache.put("c".to_owned(), 3);
/// assert_eq!(cache.get(&"b".to_owned()), None);
/// assert_eq!(cache.get(&"a".to_owned()), Some(1));
