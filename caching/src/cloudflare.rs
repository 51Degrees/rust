//! Stores over Workers KV and the Cache API, a spawner that keeps a load
//! running with the request's `wait_until`, and a clock, for
//! `wasm32-unknown-unknown` on Cloudflare Workers, turned on by the
//! `cloudflare` feature. Turn default features off, because the `pipeline`
//! feature does not build for that target.
//!
//! [`KvStore`] is global and durable, so it suits the cache of record.
//! [`CacheApi`] is the cache of the data center serving the request, so it
//! suits a layer between memory and the KV store. Each is a
//! [`ByteStore`](crate::ByteStore), made the store of a
//! [`LoadingCache`](crate::LoadingCache) by
//! [`EncodedStore`](crate::EncodedStore). The target has no system clock, so
//! give every builder a [`DateClock`].
//!
//! # Sharing a cache between requests
//!
//! A Worker isolate serves many requests at once, and a cache shared by them
//! makes each one that misses wait for the first one's load. The runtime has
//! three rules that bear on this. It may stop a load once the request that
//! started it has its response. It stops a request that has nothing of its
//! own pending as hung. And it refuses I/O a request makes in another
//! request's turn, such as building its response after being woken by that
//! request's load.
//!
//! Wrap the handling of each request in [`with_context`], and build the
//! cache with the [`WaitUntil`] spawner. The spawner keeps each load running
//! with the `wait_until` of the request that started it, and the wrapper
//! keeps a waiting request alive with a short timer and lets it go on only
//! in its own turns. Without the wrapper, a request that waits on another
//! request's load fails.
//!
