//! A cache keyed by a flow data's evidence.
//!
//! An engine holds one of these. On each request it derives a deterministic
//! [`DataKey`]
//! from the flow data's evidence (filtered by the evidence the engine accepts)
//! and uses that as the cache key. Equivalent requests therefore share a cache
//! entry regardless of evidence ordering or key casing, exactly as the
//! [caching specification](https://github.com/51Degrees/specifications/blob/main/pipeline-specification/features/caching.md#generation-of-keys)
//! requires.

/// A cache whose key is derived from a [`FlowData`]'s evidence.
///
/// `V` is the engine's cached result. It must be `Send + Sync + Clone`, so it
/// is typically an [`Arc`] around the engine's aspect-data struct, or the raw
/// cloud JSON string. Element data itself is not `Sync` and so cannot be cached
/// directly; an engine caches a thread-safe representation and rebuilds (or
/// shares) its element data from that on a hit.
///
/// The cache derives a [`DataKey`] from a flow data using the
/// [`EvidenceKeyFilter`] supplied at construction. That filter is normally the
/// engine's own [`fiftyone_pipeline_core::FlowElement::evidence_key_filter`], so
/// only the evidence the engine actually reads contributes to the key.
///
