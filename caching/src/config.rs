//! Cache configuration and the builder that applies it.

//! The two tunables match the
//! [caching specification](https://github.com/51Degrees/specifications/blob/main/pipeline-specification/features/caching.md#cache-implementation).
//! They are the total `size` (default 1000) and the `concurrency`, which is the
//! number of shards (default the number of CPU cores).

pub const DEFAULT_SIZE: usize = 1000;

/// which still yields a correct (single-shard) cache.
