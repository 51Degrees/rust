//! The on-premise aspect engine trait.
//!
//! An on-premise engine reads its evidence using one or more local data files.
//! In addition to being an [`AspectEngine`] it can refresh its data on demand
//! (when an update is downloaded or a new file appears on disk), report when the
//! data it is using was published, and report its update URL. The
//! [`crate::DataUpdateService`] drives these methods on a background thread, so
//! they MUST be thread-safe, which is why the trait requires `Send + Sync`
//! (inherited from [`FlowElement`]).
