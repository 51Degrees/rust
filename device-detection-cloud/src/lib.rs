//!
//! # 51Degrees cloud device detection
//!
//! The cloud variant of device detection. It implements the
//! [device-detection-cloud specification](https://github.com/51Degrees/specifications/blob/main/device-detection-specification/pipeline-elements/device-detection-cloud.md).
//!
//! ## What it does
//!
//! A [`fiftyone_cloud_request_engine::CloudRequestEngine`] makes a single HTTP
//! call to the 51Degrees cloud per flow data and stores the raw JSON response
//! under the `cloud` data key. [`DeviceDetectionCloudEngine`] then reads that
//! JSON, slices out the `device` member, and turns it into a
//! [`DeviceDataBase`], which it stores under [`DEVICE_DATA_KEY`].
//! It consumes no evidence of its own, so it must sit *after* a cloud request
//! engine in the pipeline.
//!
//! ## Hardware-profile lookup (TAC and native model)
//!
//! [`HardwareProfileCloudEngine`] is the second cloud engine in this crate. It
//! covers the lookups where one input parameter matches *several* device
//! profiles: a Type Allocation Code (`query.tac`) or a native model name
//! (`query.nativemodel`). It slices the response's `hardware.profiles` array and
//! turns each entry into a [`DeviceDataBase`], collecting them into a
//! [`MultiDeviceData`] stored under [`HARDWARE_DATA_KEY`]. Each profile is read
//! through the same [`DeviceData`] accessors as a single-device result. It
//! needs a resource key with the
//! hardware-profile-lookup product.
//!
//! ## Interface compatibility with the on-premise engine
//!
//! The engine produces the same concrete element-data type, under the same
//! [`TypedKey`](fiftyone_pipeline_core::TypedKey), as the on-premise Hash engine:
//! a [`DeviceDataBase`] under [`DEVICE_DATA_KEY`] (data
//! key string `"device"`). A consuming application reads the result through that
//! key, or through the shared [`DeviceData`] typed accessors,
//! and can swap a cloud engine for an on-premise one (or the reverse) without
//! touching its result-reading code. The shared model lives in the
//! `fiftyone-device-detection-shared` crate precisely so both engines depend on
//! one definition.
//!
//! ## No-value handling
//!
//! When the cloud determines no value for a property it sends JSON `null` with a
//! sibling `<property>nullreason` entry explaining why. The mapping (in the
//! private `dto` module) leaves the property absent so a typed accessor returns
//! [`AspectPropertyValue::NoValue`](fiftyone_pipeline_engines::AspectPropertyValue::NoValue),
//! while preserving the `nullreason` message in the data bag so the explanation
//! is not lost. This realises the
//! [null-values specification](https://github.com/51Degrees/specifications/blob/main/pipeline-specification/features/properties.md#null-values).
//!
//! ## Property metadata
//!
//! The set of device properties a resource key grants is known only after the
//! cloud request engine fetches its accessible properties, which it does lazily.
//! The engine therefore derives its property metadata from the request engine's
//! [`public_properties`](fiftyone_cloud_request_engine::CloudRequestEngine::public_properties)
//! on first use (or eagerly through
//! [`DeviceDetectionCloudEngineBuilder::eager_properties`]), rather than
//! hard-caching it at construction.
//!
//! ## Example
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use std::sync::Arc;
//! use fiftyone_pipeline_core::{Evidence, Pipeline};
//! use fiftyone_cloud_request_engine::CloudRequestEngine;
//! use fiftyone_device_detection_cloud::DeviceDetectionCloudEngine;
//! use fiftyone_device_detection_shared::{DeviceData, DEVICE_DATA_KEY};
//!
//! let request_engine = Arc::new(
//!     CloudRequestEngine::builder()
//!         .resource_key("my-resource-key")
//!         .build()
//!         .unwrap(),
//! );
//! let device_engine = DeviceDetectionCloudEngine::builder()
//!     .cloud_request_engine(request_engine.clone())
//!     .build();
//!
//! let pipeline = Pipeline::builder()
//!     .add_element(request_engine)
//!     .add_element(Arc::new(device_engine))
//!     .build()
//!     .unwrap();
//!
//! let mut data = pipeline.create_flow_data_with(
//!     Evidence::builder().add("header.user-agent", "Mozilla/5.0").build(),
//! );
//! data.process().unwrap();
//! if let Some(device) = data.get(DEVICE_DATA_KEY) {
//!     if let Ok(mobile) = device.is_mobile().value() {
//!         println!("IsMobile: {mobile}");
//!     }
//! }
//! ```
