<#
.SYNOPSIS
Runs every example that needs no key as someone who has just cloned the
repository would, on the free data files with no settings, and fails when one
fails.

.DESCRIPTION
Each example runs from examples/ with every _51DEGREES_ variable removed,
and every deprecated name deprecated-names/environment.rs lists for one, so
it finds the free data files in cxx/data itself. A console example is given
no arguments. Before any example starts, the data repository's script is run once,
as an example runs it, to download every free file the repository links that
is not already there, so no two examples download the same file. A try that
fails, or that does not finish in time and is stopped, is made again, and a
file still missing after the last try fails the step before the examples are
built.

The console examples must exit 0 and end with the "Find out more" section.
One that reads a 51Degrees data file must also print the contact-us link for
the Enterprise data file before that section. The pipeline examples read no
51Degrees data file, so they have no such link to give. A data file an
example could not download fails the step too. An example that runs too long
is stopped with every process it started, so a download it began cannot keep
a file open for the next one. The web examples are started, and their page is
held to the same rules.

The usage-sharing example is not run, because it sends what it holds to the
usage sharing service when it ends.

Each example's output is printed in a group, and the lines about the
Enterprise data file and any download are printed outside the groups so the
log shows them without opening one.

The examples are built against this tree's crates, through
ci/test-examples-against-source.ps1, which leaves the working tree as it
found it.
