#
# Each crate is published only when its current version is not already on
# crates.io, so an ordinary push that does not bump the version is a no-op.
# The version is not committed in the manifests. The publish workflow works it
# out from the tags with GitVersion and ci/set-crate-versions.ps1 writes it into
# every crate, so all of them move together, as the packages of the other five
# languages do. Three crates once reached 4.6 while the other twenty one stayed
# at 4.5.2, which is what holding them in step prevents.
# After publishing a crate the script waits for the new version to appear on the
# index so the next, dependent crate resolves it.
#
# `fodid` and `fiftyone-fodid-cloud` need no OWID crate from any registry. The
# OWID source is compiled into `fodid` from the owid-rust submodule by
# ci/copy-owid-source.ps1, which the publish workflow runs before this script,
# and the `fodid` manifest lists the copied directory in its `include` so that
# `cargo publish` packages it even though git ignores it.
