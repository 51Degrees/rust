.SYNOPSIS
Writes one version into every crate manifest and every requirement between
them, so the workspace releases as a set.

.DESCRIPTION
The other five languages take their version from a tag through GitVersion and
publish the whole family at that one number. Rust carried a version in each
manifest instead, which meant three places to change, three numbers that could
drift apart, and a release decided by whoever edited a file rather than by a
tag.

This makes Rust behave like the rest. The publish workflow computes the next
version from the tags and calls this, so nothing in the repository states a
version and no commit can release one by accident.

Both the crate versions and the requirements between them are written. A
requirement left behind is worse than one never written: `cargo publish`
accepts it and the crate then cannot resolve from the registry, which is how
`fodid-client` came to require `fodid 4.6` after 4.6 was yanked.

.PARAMETER Version
The version to write, such as 4.5.6.

.PARAMETER Root
The workspace root. Defaults to the repository this script sits in.
